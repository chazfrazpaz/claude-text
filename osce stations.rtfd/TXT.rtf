Station 1 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This station was preceded an active bye in which the candidate watched a modified (shortened) video of a \'91Strange Situation\'92 procedure. The mother and her infant have been identified as at risk due to the mother\'92s past history of substance misuse and schizophrenia. The candidate is expected to evaluate the interaction between the mother and her child, looking for strengths and difficulties. In Station 1, the candidate is to address the concerns of the child protection worker, who is new to this work, and suggest further interventions to support the mother-child dyad in the future. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 Examiners felt that this was a very discriminating station, but that it was poorly performed by many candidates, who appeared to lack the knowledge required to achieve a pass. Candidates were clearly not familiar with the different types of attachment and so were unable to explain these in a discriminating manner. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 2 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This viva station tested consultancy skills in clinical, ethical and professional realms. The station\'92s scenario concerned a 13-year-old boy with suicidal ideation who has been referred by a Nurse Practitioner to a poorly resourced mental health service in a remote area where a locum consultant is about to fly out at the end of their contract. Candidates were to demonstrate their ability to make safe clinical decisions, under time contingent conditions, without full information being available. They were then asked to consider any issues arising out of the performance of the Nurse Practitioner. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 Examiners said that this was very reasonable content for a junior consultant level and contained a good mix of thinking on fact, clinical content and ethical consideration. Better candidates did well, with the poorer candidates showing a lack of appreciation of remote/rural for service provision. Few candidates mentioned the importance of a suicidal teenager needing to be seen within 24 hours. Examiners noted that the management plans did not take into consideration the rural environs and were often unrealistic. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 The examiners also noted that a number of candidates appeared not to read the question properly. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 3 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This station required the candidate to assess a person who is soon to attend court to face criminal charges, for the presence of psychiatric disorder including personality disorder. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 Examiners considered this to be a straightforward station but were disappointed that many candidates struggled to formulate in real time and that they did not manage their time efficiently. Candidates were seemingly thrown by the formal medicolegal aspect of this station and very few considered/discussed the impact of this on confidentiality. Some candidates enquired whether the patient actually required a report. Of grave concern to the Examiners was that the risk element was not properly addressed by candidates. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 4 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 In this viva station the candidate was to evaluate and manage new onset psychotic symptoms in a 76-year-old man referred from a nursing home. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 Examiners were impressed how candidates handled this station, but a number of candidates struggled to manage their time in the station and did not complete the short-term management plan. Unsuccessful candidates were providing generic dementia management and did not justify their answers. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 5 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This station concerned the complexity of managing a situation of a mentally unwell father of a psychiatric inpatient. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 Examiners noted that a number of candidates struggled to manage the interview and to de-escalate the hypomanic behaviour of the father. They took vague histories and the diagnosis given often did not match the mental state provided. A number of candidates either ignored or glossed over the ethical issues related to assessment and decision making of a patient\'92s family member.

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 6 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This station covered the diagnosing and managing of a conversion disorder in a female refugee. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 Examiners found this to be a good and discriminating station. Weaker candidates were simplistic and superficial in their diagnostic explanation and their management plans were generic \'96 a check list. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 7 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This was the Medical Disorders in Psychiatry station and covered lithium toxicity and hyperthyroidism. The candidate was expected to obtain relevant history, and interpret laboratory tests to diagnose underlying hyperthyroidism plus lithium toxicity due to interactions with pain medications commenced recently by the GP. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 Examiners felt that this was a good station to test the basic understanding of psychopharmacology and expected this task to be completed well. They were alarmed when some candidates kept saying \'93there was no lithium level on the blood tests\'94 and so appeared not to be able to make an assessment on the information clinical provided. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 Better candidates read the tasks properly and managed their time well and approached the station in a focussed manner. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 8 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This station concerned a RANZCP Stage 1 psychiatric trainee who had been referred to a private psychiatrist for diagnostic clarification due to concerns of a possible depressive disorder. The candidate was to differentiate between burnout and a clinical depressive disorder. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 Examiners thought this to be a discriminating station and a good test of consultancy skills. Many candidates were not aware of the features of burnout as a syndrome, whilst some were diagnosing adjustment disorder versus major depression. Many candidates were equivocal regarding whether the trainee should be referred to the medical board, nor did they address the issue of confidentiality. Some said they would write to the supervisor/director of training. Many candidates pathologised drinking one glass of wine per night, but they did not ask about caffeine intake. Examiners were surprised at the suggestion of using SSRIs as a treatment for burnout. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 9 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 In this station, the candidate was expected to be able to discuss the three stages of a cognitive behaviour therapy plan for the treatment of a single phobia, fear of flying, in a mother wanting to attend her daughter\'92s wedding overseas. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 Examiners thought this to be a simple straight forward station, though some candidates misread the instructions and described what a psychologist would do, as opposed to them taking on the role themselves. A number of candidates planned Behavioural Therapy with no cognitive element despite the instructions, whilst others focussed on ascertaining knowledge of CBT rather than providing an explanation. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 10 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This was the core skills station, which required the candidate to perform and present a mental state examination (MSE) and clarify the MSE symptoms elicited by a junior doctor. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 As this is a core task of a psychiatrist, Examiners thought that this should have been a straight forward station, however, they were extremely disappointed at the performance of many candidates who had a limited skills and knowledge of a mental state examination. Again, time management was poorly done. Many candidates struggled and they did not have enough time to complete the second & third tasks, despite having the information provided to them. A number of candidates thought that the patient was hallucinating and many incorrectly agreed with the diagnosis of schizophrenia. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 11 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 In this station candidates were to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of Motivational Interviewing (MI) skills and strategies to effectively engage a patient with cannabis dependence. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 1 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This station was preceded by an active bye. Candidates were asked to analyse clinical performance data on seclusion rates in four local hospitals and provide a basic graphical representation. Candidates were expected to identify that there has been an increase in the seclusion figures in one of the local hospitals and they were to discuss factors that may explain variations in the seclusion rates and to identify strategies to reduce said seclusion rates. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 Examiners noted that not all candidates drew graphs; whilst some drew four different types of graphs! A number of candidates appeared to find it difficult to organise their tasks appropriately. Discussion was often very generalised without reference to the specific data or to trends over time. Examiners also commented that candidates who stated they were currently working in In-Patient Units appeared more at ease with this task. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 2 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This station concerned ECT and required the candidate to engage and educate a medical student who is a novice in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and demonstrate knowledge of technical administration and clinical aspects of ECT . 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 Examiners thought this was one area of expertise, psychiatrists MUST have and found the cohort\'92s patchy knowledge disappointing. A number of candidates knew a lot about ECT but they did not necessarily always address the prescribed tasks. Examiners were disappointed at the array of responses regarding the placement of electrodes \'96 some candidates were clearly unaware of basic electrode placement positions. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 3 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This station concerned a young female with social anxiety and gender dysphoria. The candidate\'92s tasks were to talk to patient about their anxiety, provide a diagnosis and management plan, explore some of her gender questions, and consider whether further assistance with gender identity might be required. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 Examiners noted that some candidates were confused about the difference between bullying and social anxiety. A number of candidates undertook a HEADSS (home, education, activities, drugs, suicide and sex) which did not assist them to target the specific tasks. Some candidates looked for only one diagnosis. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 4 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This was a short viva Governance Skills station, relating to an alleged sexual assault in an adult inpatient psychiatry unit. The station requires the candidate to present the immediate and longer-term management of this situation. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 While there was some variable performance of candidates, in general this was one of the best performing stations. It was noted that candidates addressed clinical governance matters far better than the practical management issues. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 5 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This station dealt with Somatic Symptom Disorder / Chronic Pain Syndrome and the history taking, diagnosis/differential diagnosis and management plan of the patient. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 Examiners found that on the whole, candidates had a poor understanding of the somataform disorder. A number of candidates incorrectly directed their focus to medico-legal issues. Time management was also an issue, with numerous candidates running out of time. Examiners commented that given the candidate performance in the station, they appeared not to have read the instructions. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 6 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This station involved the candidate talking to a concerned son of a female patient, who has an eating disorder. Candidates who struggled obviously had not been exposed to an eating disorder service. Examiners commented that the poorer candidates rattled off lists, were unfamiliar with a BMI Chart and had not read the RANZCP clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of eating disorders. This was one of the poorly performing stations.

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 7 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This station required the candidate to explore the concerns of a community mental health nurse with respect to a former patient, whose current behaviour was causing distress. Candidates were to make sense of the history obtained from the community mental health nurse, and describe diagnoses of grief and dependent personality with relevant differential diagnoses. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 Examiners noted that candidates did not question the nurse\'92s assessment of the situation. Formulation was undertaken in a mediocre fashion and that a scattergun approach was taken with respect to giving a diagnosis. A number of candidates took the decision to refer the patient on for what might be seen as basic psychotherapy, which does not demonstrate the capacity of a Consultant Psychiatrist to undertake a basic psychotherapeutic role if required. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 8 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This was the Medicine in Psychiatry station. In this station the candidate was required to take a history from a 56-year-old married man who has developed psychiatric symptoms following the recent administration of corticosteriods to treat asthma. Candidates were to elicit sufficient information to make a diagnosis of steroid induced mood disorder (depression with psychotic features) which the candidate needs to explain to the patient. The candidate was then expected to present a treatment plan to the examiner. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 Many candidates demonstrated poor time management. Candidates who did not read the instructions carefully, took the wrong path and focused their attention and time on delirium, despite no findings of delirium. Candidates also failed to discuss risk. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 9 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This was a core skills station and examiners were surprised at the varied performances delivered on the day. The candidates were to assess a 26-year old male university student who has an established diagnosis of obsessive- compulsive disorder and has been on treatment for the past year. The GP has referred the patient for further assessment as there may be the development of psychotic symptoms. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 Candidates were expected to conduct a tailored mental state examination, including differentiating between psychotic symptoms and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Candidates were also to differentiate between delusions and obsessions in the mental state examination, and present a preferred diagnosis and differential diagnoses. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 Many candidates did not carefully read the \'91Candidate Instructions\'92 and hence lost marks. Mismanagement of time also proved to be the undoing for many candidates. Examiners found that very few candidates explored OCD and delusions in detail. A number of candidates ignored the requirement to undertake a Mental State Examination, whilst a number instead undertook a cognitive assessment, despite explicit instructions that it was not required. Examiners were concerned to see that those who undertook the MSE, that much of their skill levels were lacking. Examiners were surprised on how few candidates knew the phenomenology of OCD and how few candidates linked psychotic symptoms to OCD. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 10 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 In this station candidates were required to assess a 45-year-old male veteran who has Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and some current psychosocial stressors, who presents with questions regarding non- pharmacological management of PTSD. Candidates were to demonstrate competence in engaging the patient and addressing their concerns, and identify factors contributing to the presentation and to discuss suitable psychotherapy modalities and other psychotherapeutic interventions for PTSD. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 Examiners found that many in the cohort lacked a basic knowledge of psychological interventions for PTSD and hence gave limited responses or ignored the task altogether. Whilst on the other hand, a number of candidates focus was on the symptoms of PTSD, to the exclusion of the actual psychological interventions. There was a theme of referring the patient to a psychologist. While in practice, there are often roles for other practitioners, the OCSE is seeking to have the candidate demonstrate their understanding of basic psychotherapy. This was the most poorly performing station. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 1 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This was a viva station preceded by an Active Bye station. The Active Bye required the candidate to watch a\uc0\u8232 16 minute video of an interview between a Stage 1 Trainee (registrar) for whom they were the supervisor. The registrar had interviewed a patient with depression and psychotic symptoms. The station examined the candidate\'92s ability to assess a patient\'92s mental state, formulate differential diagnoses and provide an initial management plan based on their observations. The candidate was then required to present the feedback they would provide to the Stage 1 trainee on his interview. Examiners noted that overall, the performance of candidates in this core skill station was poor and not to the standard of a Junior Consultant. Many candidates struggled to present a mental state examination and to formulate. Examiners also noted that management plans were formulaic and they were quite surprised to find that phenomenology was also poorly done. Examiners reported that candidates experienced some difficulty with the role of supervision.

\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This station concerned the mother of 19-year-old female inpatient who had been recently admitted with first episode of mania. The patient had been moved to the High Dependency Unit (HDU) / Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) following an assault and minor injury by another patient. The mother was advised of the incident only when she arrived on the ward. A meeting had been arranged with the mother to discuss the incident and ongoing management. The main assessment aims were to listen to the concerns of the parent and address these concerns appropriately; to gather history of the patient; provide psychoeducation and to discuss an immediate management plan that encompassed the ongoing risk. Examiners reported that some candidates seemed to have no difficulty in understanding the scenario but a number floundered. It was pleasing that many candidates apologized for the incident, however, candidates did not consistently demonstrate understanding of their role as a consultant psychiatrist in the complaint management and incident review process. Many candidates did not address the history, psychoeducation and management plan.

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 3 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This was the Medicine in Psychiatry station. Candidates were asked to review a man with schizoaffective disorder who is on multiple medications, and who had been referred by his GP for assessment of symptoms and a medication review. The main assessment aims of the station were to undertake a focused physical examination to exclude cardiac abnormalities and identify metabolic syndrome; to accurately interpret investigation results (ECG and blood investigations); to identify cardiovascular risks related to psychotropic polypharmacy and to present the diagnosis and management plan to the examiner. Examiners for the most part were disappointed with the cohort\'92s performance in this station. Candidates could not interpret results; could not associate side effects to medications; patient\'92s concerns were not addressed; time management was an issue; tasks were not targeted, there was often a disorganised approach and the physical examination tasks were not prioritised. Overall Station 3 was one of the stations that discriminated well between candidates.

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 4 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This was a short viva station. Candidates were asked to assess a woman with schizophrenia who had mild symptoms of relapse in the context of relationship stress. Candidates were asked to consider the potential causes of the presentation, and identify the important features of domestic violence (DV) that need to be addressed further with the patient and to describe an appropriate range of interventions to support her. The impression of the Examiners was that female candidates tended to do better in this station than their male counterparts. The majority of candidates focused either on the patient\'92s diagnosis and treatment or the partner using drugs and brushed over the patient\'92s injuries. Examiners felt that this station required a holistic approach which should be within the capabilities of a junior consultant. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 5 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This station concerned a 36-year-old male patient with history of schizophrenia and polysubstance dependence, who is being treated with olanzapine long-acting injectable (LAI), and is also on pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin for Hepatitis C. The case manager has booked him in for review as he is concerned about his mood. Candidates were expected to demonstrate knowledge of neuropsychological side-effects of Hepatitis C and its treatments. They were required to demonstrate an ability to assess for relapse of substance use, to generate a robust management plan, and explain the plan to the patient. They were also expected to accurately assess a range of potential aetiologies of a mood disorder. This station was generally completed fairly well. Many candidates demonstrated knowledge of the side-effects of interferon, however, many missed eliciting the severity of symptoms which would guide management plans. Some candidates developed particularly good formulations, but this was not a universal finding. Some candidates failed to check for relapse into substance misuse.

\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This station dealt with assessment of \'91fitness to drive\'92 for a 29 year old male, with continuing mild symptoms following a manic episode. The candidate was to respond to the patient\'92s request to be certified as fit to drive. This required the candidate to negotiate a plan with the patient around driving, and to demonstrate their understanding of ethical issues pertinent to \'91fitness to drive\'92. A number of candidates managed their time poorly in this station, with the result that they did not complete all tasks. Some found it difficult to advise the patient they should not be driving, and to explain why.

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 7 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 In this station, a patient with stable bipolar disorder had requested an appointment to discuss her three year-old son whose kindergarten teacher has requested that he be assessed for a possible Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The mother wanted to know what ASD is, how it is diagnosed and how it is managed. Examiners reported that the majority of candidates were able to discuss the misconceptions concerning vaccinations and the causes of ASD. Some candidates appeared to lack knowledge of the biological, psychological and social therapies that can be used in the management of ASD. Overall, candidates performed quite well on this station. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 8 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This station deals with a 69-year-old woman with a history of panic disorder and stable long-term benzodiazepine use. Candidates were to make recommendations to her GP regarding ongoing care. The main assessment aims directed candidates to evaluate the symptoms of panic attack in order to ascertain the therapeutic necessity for continuation of benzodiazepines; to demonstrate knowledge of the evidence base around long-term benzodiazepine use, and alternative treatments in the management of chronic anxiety and to weigh the risks and benefits of long-term use of benzodiazepines in this patient. Examiners reported that candidates generally demonstrated broad knowledge of panic disorder although some focused inappropriately on generalised anxiety disorder. Some candidates focused too much on benzodiazepine dependence and seemed to imply that the patient was an addict. A minority of the cohort considered tapering benzodiazepine use rather than maintaining dosage. The marking grid required candidates to allow the option of the patient remaining on her current dose of the benzodiazepine as an appropriate course of action and few or no candidates appeared prepared to give this advice. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 9 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This station concerned a 20-year-old female with borderline personality disorder who, after a relatively stable period, had recently overdosed on a small quantity of paracetamol. The tasks were to sensitively manage the interaction with an irritable and challenging patient in crisis; to gather information about the patient\'92s intent to self- harm and to demonstrate familiarity with current guidelines on management of borderline personality disorder. The candidate was also expected to de-escalate the patient\'92s distress triggered by an unhelpful comment made by an emergency department nurse and then proceed to the assessment. Examiners anticipated that this might be a challenging station for candidates and were impressed that the cohort generally performed well. The role player had been trained to appear quite agitated initially, which was confronting for many candidates. Candidates were expected to demonstrate a respectful, sensitive approach to the situation. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 10 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This station concerned a 34-year-old married male, who suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and is being treated with exposure and response prevention therapy (ERP). The candidate has been working with him for two (2) months in an outpatient clinic. His wife has come to an arranged appointment to discuss her husband\'92s progress. Candidates were required to demonstrate the ability to communicate the principles of psychological therapy for treatment of OCD; to demonstrate knowledge of how to monitor symptoms of OCD using rating scales and to outline the importance of family when intervening in anxiety disorders. Although this station was done well by a number of candidates, many others presented generic and formulaic responses suggesting little depth of knowledge. Many described non-pharmacological treatments with no particular efficacy for OCD, such as progressive muscle relaxation (PMR). Others mentioned exposure response prevention therapy (ERP) and cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) but with limited evidence of knowledge around their practical application. However, overall this station was generally done well. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 11 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Candidates were required to assess a man with bipolar disorder, which has for the most part been well controlled. He has occasionally become acutely unwell leading to involuntary admissions, and requiring Clopixol-Acuphase\'ae injection to control his agitation. He would like to make an advance health directive to decline the use of intramuscular Clopixol-Acuphase\'ae in the future. Candidates were to obtain adequate information about previous treatments for this patient with bipolar disorder and to weigh up ethical considerations regarding an advance health directive for this patient. Many candidates struggled to articulate the limitations of an advance directive. Some candidates seemed to be unaware that a prompt was to be given at 6 minutes directing the candidates to the last task, which was to outline to the examiner, the ethical implications of advance directives in psychiatry. \

\f0\b \cf2 Station Summary: 
\f1\b0\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 1 
\f2\b0 In this station, candidates were required to demonstrate the capacity to engage an Indigenous patient, a lawyer, and to put him at ease, display respect and a capacity to work with a person of different cultural background and to take a history that recognised the importance of cultural heritage to the individual and incorporate that into the formulation presented to the examiner. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 A number of candidates took notice of the available cues that this station was predominantly about cultural aspects and risk assessment and prioritised these accordingly. Some candidates found it difficult to meet some of the cultural competencies and the majority of candidates tended to focus on general history rather than cultural context of the history provided. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 2 
\f2\b0 was the Core Skills station, where candidates were expected to outline the management of a 54-year-old man with treatment-resistant depression, who has been referred to a Community Acute Care Team by a private psychiatrist, against a background of polypharmacy. This was a challenging station for a number of candidates. Better candidates differentiated melancholic/non-melancholic depression. A number of candidates missed or did not consider the ethical issues inherent in polypharmacy prescribing and possible Code of Conduct implications in this station. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 3 
\f2\b0 In this station candidates were to assess a 69-year-old male with a history of depression and concerns regarding decline in his cognition despite an improvement in his depressive symptoms. Candidates were to demonstrate their ability to accurately choose and undertake a series of bedside cognitive tests and incorporate available information to come to a preferred diagnosis of Alzheimer\'92s dementia. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 A number of the cohort jumped into performing a frontal lobe assessment only. Some candidates appeared to struggle with providing a running commentary to accompany the cognitive assessment. Some candidates performed their own version of established cognitive tests and a number of candidates were not able to correctly comprehend and interpret the MRI report, with a number not identifying the evident temporal lobe atrophy. In general there was a generic and formulaic management plan which did not meet the standard of a junior consultant. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 4 
\f2\b0 In this Viva station candidates were to discuss an approach to undertaking an audit the monitoring of metabolic syndrome assessment in patients with schizophrenia in a community mental health centre. Candidates were expected to outline the key measures and their overall frequency of assessment. They were then expected to describe the process of audit, including the importance of feedback in any continuous quality improvement activity, and to consider likely barriers to assessing how well health professionals are performing against accepted standards and guidelines. The candidate was also expected to describe their role in conducting an audit within a multidisciplinary team environment. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This was a discriminating station and on the whole and it was poorly done. Feedback from Examiners was that candidates did not read their instructions and only focused on importance of monitoring metabolic syndrome and the importance of managing it. Variation in responses from candidates indicated limited understanding of the differences between a survey, research and audit. Knowledge and application of the audit cycle was poorly demonstrated. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 5 
\f2\b0 In this station candidates were to assess a 69-year-old man with Parkinson\'92s Disease. The candidate was also expected to identify a range of differential diagnoses and specifically consider depressive disorders and apathy. Candidates performed well in this station, though some did have issues with time management. Superior candidates presented a much more focused and appropriate diagnosis. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 6 
\f2\b0 This station involved an outpatient review of a currently stable 34-year-old female with bipolar disorder and a history of severe manic episodes, in the context of her husband being convinced she is relapsing. Candidates were to evaluate the ability to distinguish normal range of mood versus abnormal mood states in bipolar disorder. This station was generally undertaken well by the cohort, with the assessment done very well, though candidates struggled to talk about the home environment, expressed emotion and how to deal with husband\'92s concerns. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 7 
\f2\b0 was a Viva station which expected candidates to demonstrate their knowledge of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, including historical factors, identification, differential diagnosis and their management. Examiners felt that candidates should be able to demonstrate good understanding of this core content. Overall the differential diagnosis was done well but the history was often read as \'93how to take a history for negative Schizophrenia\'94 instead of the \'93historical aspects of the concept of negative symptoms in schizophrenia\'94.

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 8 
\f2\b0 relates to an interview with a parent in relation to his concerns about his 8-year-old son who has Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) who was being bullied at school. The candidate was expected to demonstrate that they are familiar with common mental health issues caused by bullying through an interview situation that required the candidate to elicit and establish the range and severity of parental concerns in relation to an ASD child. Candidates found this to be a challenging station with many candidates running out time. Some candidates struggled with history taking from a parent and were unsure on how to advise about what to do with regarding to bullying. Very few candidates asked about depression and self-harm, while some candidates focused on sexual abuse and deviated from the tasks at hand. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 9 
\f2\b0 In this station the candidate was asked to meet with the sister of a patient who was admitted to a medical ward with complications related to anorexia nervosa. The candidates tasks were to convey information about anorexia nervosa, provide information about the medical complications of this disorder and answer any questions. Candidates struggled with this station with many delivering a marginal performance. Many candidates were unable to empathically interact with the anxious relative of a patient who is seriously ill, particularly in the context of concerns that the patient may die. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 10 
\f2\b0 required candidates to take a focussed drug and alcohol history from a 25-year-old woman who has taken an accidental overdose of over-the-counter opioids. Examiners were to evaluate the candidate\'92s ability to take a focussed drug and alcohol history, and establish opioid dependence (codeine) based on the findings. Candidates were also expected to outline management options for opioid dependence. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Examiners found this station to be straight forward and clear in its tasks. Most candidates had assessed the history and diagnosis well but failed to elicit the dependence criteria sufficiently. A number of candidates appeared to be unfamiliar with the product \'91
\f3\i Nurofen plus
\f2\i0 \'92. Time management was an issue with a number of candidates running out time. Examiners observed that management was poorly handled, with the main outcome being a referral to the local Drug and Alcohol Service as opposed to candidates being able to accurately provide information about interventions. It appears that some candidates may have read the Candidate Instructions incorrectly, directing their focus to the management of insomnia. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 11 
\f2\b0 related to a 40-year-old single female, suffering from generalised anxiety disorder who was attending her first appointment for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). The candidate was to review her symptoms and then explain the process of CBT. Examiners found a disconnect between \'93doctor and patient\'94, as candidates lacked ability to show empathy toward the patient. Few candidates identified the diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder. Some candidates seemed to have knowledge but struggled to explain the history, which was often covered in breadth rather than depth. A number of candidates achieved the standard for diagnosis, but provided a disorganised or unclear explanation of therapy. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2 Station 1 
\f2\b0 Candidates were asked to elicit the phenomenology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs29\fsmilli14667 develop a management plan in a patient with difficult to treat OCD. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 Station 2 
\f2\b0 required candidates to undertake a focused history of depression and suicide risk from a 58 year old divorcee with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS). Candidates were to demonstrate through questions some knowledge of MS, the side effects of main drug treatments and develop a management plan that included collaboration with GP and neurologist. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 Station 3 
\f2\b0 In this station, candidates were to conduct a physical examination that may occur in a community setting. The focus was on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems in a person who is soon to be started on clozapine. Candidates were judged on their ability to conduct an examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems and their ability to simultaneously convey a commentary on the process to the examiner. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 Station 4 
\f2\b0 required candidates to assess, discuss findings and propose an initial management plan in a young woman who presented with antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction since commencing an SSRI for the treatment of depression. Candidates were required to prioritise and explain the phenomenon of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction, recognise the importance to the patient of her sexual functioning and demonstrate this in the management plan. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 Station 5 
\f2\b0 was a Modified Viva station. Candidates were asked to explain normal and abnormal attachment to a supervisor, describe the specific impact of maternal depression on attachment and how attachment can be assessed during an initial consultation with a mother infant dyad. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 Station 6 
\f2\b0 directed candidates to take a history of symptoms of mental illness in a person with epilepsy and to communicate clinical information, including the most likely diagnosis and differential diagnoses, to the medical student/trainee registrar using appropriate concepts and terminology. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 Station 7 
\f2\b0 focused on the candidate\'92s ability to assess and formulate a management plan for a young man in an emergency department setting exhibiting behaviour disturbance following methamphetamine abuse. The candidate\'92s ability to de-escalate the situation and establish rapport with an acutely disturbed person was paramount to a successful outcome. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 Station 8 
\f2\b0 was a Viva station. In this station the candidate was required to demonstrate knowledge of the impact of schizophrenia on pregnancy and parenting and place these issues in the context of the major ethical principles of medicine as they relate to the option of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) in a 41 year old single woman with treatment resistant schizophrenia. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 Station 9 
\f2\b0 required candidates to demonstrate their capacity to engage an Indigenous patient, demonstrate cultural awareness by responding appropriately to questions from the patient about where the candidate was from and why they wanted the interview, and to take a history that encompassed cultural issues. The candidate was required to present their cultural formulation to the examiner. It was expected that candidates would recognise that the patient\'92s presentation was outside of culturally acceptable boundaries of normality. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 Station 10 
\f2\b0 was a Viva station focusing on the candidate\'92s knowledge of professional boundaries and ethical obligations. Candidates were to identify the issues related to the management of boundaries within a therapeutic relationship with a person with borderline personality disorder. Candidates were to explain their understanding of boundary violation and to articulate that sexual relationships between patient and doctor are a breach of the RANZCP College Code of Conduct. They were also expected to acknowledge that this act requires mandatory notification to AHPRA/NZ Medical Council. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 Station 1 
\f2\b0 was the medical station. Candidates were to take a focussed history from the patient, to perform a focussed physical examination and develop an initial management plan for a patient presenting in the early stages of metabolic syndrome. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs29\fsmilli14667 Candidate performance and time management showed great variability. Many neglected diagnostic and management aspects of the tasks. The assessment objective was clear but candidates seemed to interpret the task as an assessment of cardiovascular disease and implications of diabetes, rather than focussing on metabolic syndrome. Most candidates failed to perform a 
\f3\i focussed 
\f2\i0 physical examination, instead performing a much more extensive physical examination than was expected, thus losing time. Many appeared confused by the number of items in the standard issue College medical kit. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 Station 2 
\f2\b0 Candidates were to take a focussed history of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and to provide education to the patient regarding differential diagnosis and modalities of treatment. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs29\fsmilli14667 Most candidates managed their time reasonably but some seemed to ignore the information provided in the GP\'92s letter. A majority of candidates performed well, with substance abuse history and psychological therapies addressed. However, a number of candidates had difficulty in explaining treatment options and had a limited formulation. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs29\fsmilli14667 OSCE candidates overall performed very well on this station. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 Station 3 
\f2\b0 Candidates were asked to take a history from a patient to confirm a diagnosis of Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Candidates were assessed on their ability to take a focussed history, gather relevant information and to formulate a diagnosis; and their ability to develop a management plan for the treatment of this condition. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs29\fsmilli14667 Examiners noted variable candidate performance across the streams. Some candidates did well, but others did not follow instructions which clearly indicated that and diagnosis/management be communicated to the patient rather than examiners. Candidates are reminded to carefully read the instructions to determine whom they are to present their findings to.

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2 Station 4 
\f2\b0 was a Child and Adolescent station. The main task was to provide psychoeducation to a school counsellor about adolescent depression. Candidates were asked to demonstrate knowledge of adolescent depression and an ability to communicate this information effectively to a professional who works in a non-health setting. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs29\fsmilli14667 Many candidates failed to read the instructions and identify role player\'92s role. There was a broad range of candidate performance observed across both the OSCE and the MOSCE. While many candidates performed well in the station, many candidates neglected a collaborative approach to management. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 Station 5 
\f2\b0 (OSCE) was a viva station. Candidates were asked to assess and manage a situation which signalled possible impairment in a junior medical colleague, and explain to the examiner the chosen course of action. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs29\fsmilli14667 Examiners were looking for skill in identifying key issues for a troubled junior colleague and in developing an appropriate response. In the ideal performance, candidates demonstrated a knowledge of the clinical and personality issues which may result in impairment in doctors and knowledge of professional, organisational and statutory obligations. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs29\fsmilli14667 Some candidates did not follow instructions and addressed the \'91doctor\'92 rather than the examiner. There were considerable deficits in the understanding of clinical governance and mandatory reporting. A number of candidates across the streams were not aware of AHPRA/New Zealand Medical Council\'92s role in such situations. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 Station 5 
\f2\b0 (MOSCE) was a viva station. Candidates were to demonstrate an understanding of how to manage important information from police regarding alleged use of illicit substances by staff members. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs29\fsmilli14667 Examiners were seeking demonstration of the candidate\'92s ability to consider the implications of substance misuse for decision-making, and treatment of patients; their understanding of wider governance and reporting requirements; and their knowledge of the impact of alcohol and/or drug use on clinical practice more generally. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs29\fsmilli14667 Examiners noted a wide range of standards within the MOSCE streams and often limited knowledge of the role of Governance protocols in such a scenario. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 Station 6 
\f2\b0 was a viva station
\f0\b . 
\f2\b0 Candidates were asked to review electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) records (including EEG recordings) to identify the parameters that reflect quality of the seizure, especially post- ictal suppression, but also seizure duration, amplitude and left-right symmetry. They were also assessed on the ability to decide which dose to give the patient next and the ability to give a rationale for their decision. MOSCE candidates were expected to give a more precise recommendation regarding the next dose of ECT, as though they would be writing the order. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f4\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 1 
\f5\b0 was a Child and Adolescent station. Candidates were asked to identify and explain the issues to be considered in the presentation of mental disorders in persons with developmental disorder/intellectual disability and the key principles in adapting clinical approach for the individual and the family/carers. In general this was considered by examiners to be a good station that discriminated candidates well. Some candidates found it difficult to complete all five questions and did not appear to consider the likely weightings of the questions. Overall OSCE candidates did well in this station, however, MOSCE results suggest that candidates were insufficiently prepared to perform adequately in this station. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f4\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 2 
\f5\b0 was the Medicine in Psychiatry station and dealt with hyperthyroidism. Candidates were requested to take a relevant medical history and to conduct a focused physical examination. Following on from this, candidates were assessed on their ability to integrate and interpret findings from history, physical examination, and laboratory tests to make an accurate diagnosis. Their third task was the ability to communicate with the patient concerning the nature of the problem and the implications for treatment. This was a complex station which required the candidate to switch between discussion with a patient and an examiner. Some candidates failed to understand instructions or managed their time poorly. For MOSCE and, to a lesser degree, OSCE candidates\'92 poor physical examination technique remains an area of concern. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f4\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 3 
\f5\b0 required the examiner to evaluate the candidate\'92s interview technique, ability to identify the key problem of insomnia, and clarification of the \'91patient\'92s\'92 request for non-pharmacological treatment. There was wide variation in performance standard by candidates, with well organised candidates able to complete all tasks expected. Problem areas for those who did not do well appeared to be poor time management, or spending too much time focusing on resolution of depressive symptoms as opposed to focusing on the sleep problem. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f4\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 4 
\f5\b0 tested the candidate\'92s ability to take a focussed history from a reluctant new father and to reach a diagnosis of depression. The candidates were then to present their diagnosis and differential diagnosis to the examiner. Some candidates made the error of focusing on the problems the wife was facing instead of those of the father. Passing candidates generally did well in this station although there was a spread in performance. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f4\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 5 
\f5\b0 asked candidates to assess and manage a patient\'92s request to prolong a course of psychotherapy for a patient who has a dependent personality. Their second task was to demonstrate familiarity with communicating with patients who have dependent personality traits. The candidate\'92s third assessment task was to demonstrate skills in negotiating psychotherapy process with dependent patients. Although many candidates performed well in this station, those who did not focussed too quickly on management at the expense of formulating the issue. This also raised the question of candidates\'92 experience in psychotherapy. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f4\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 6 
\f5\b0 was set in a Consultation Liaison service. The candidate\'92s tasks were to explain to the patient the diagnosis of hypochondriasis including its clinical manifestations. They were to outline to the patient the link between mind and body and to recognise the clinical issues around a patient accepting this diagnosis. The candidate was expected to deal tactfully and empathically with the patient\'92s concerns. This was considered by examiners to be a good station to discriminate performance of candidates. Concern was raised that candidates performing less well used excessive questioning and showed little evidence of a capacity for empathic listening, which in turn led to poor engagement with patients. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f4\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 7 
\f5\b0 required the candidate to have knowledge of alcohol dependence, the range of biological and psychological treatments of alcohol dependence and the skill to communicate to the patient the management options available. While there were some outstanding performances and a good spread of marks those candidates who did not pass tended not to manage their time well or appeared disorganised in their approach. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f4\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 8 (OSCE) 
\f5\b0 required OSCE candidates to clarify and describe temporal lobe epilepsy to a patient and to explain the procedure of an electroencephalogram (EEG). This was a straightforward station with the majority of candidates performing very well. A small minority of candidates did not perform well, including showing lack of basic knowledge of the process of an EEG. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f4\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 8 (MOSCE) 
\f5\b0 asked MOSCE candidates to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in conducting a clinical assessment of temporal lobe functions. This was a similarly structured station to previous examinations, however many candidates appeared disorganised and appeared to find it difficult to instruct the patient and provide commentary of their examination. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f4\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 9 
\f5\b0 expected candidates to assess the wife of a patient in the Emergency Department after she had taken an impulsive overdose of ten tablets of temazepam 10mg. The overdose occurred in the context of an adjustment disorder secondary to her husband\'92s behaviour (a result of delusional jealousy). The candidate was required to take a focussed history and formulate a specific management plan to address the impact of the husband\'92s jealousy. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 1 
\f2 was the \'91Medical Disorders in Psychiatry\'92 station with the additional blueprint descriptor of \'91Child & Adolescent Disorders\'92. The task was to assess, by history and physical examination, an 18 year patient with a 4 year history consistent with Bulimia Nervosa, in the setting of an outpatient Eating Disorders clinic. The examination was to be tailored to his presentation of both Bulimia Nervosa and medical complications (in this case cardiovascular). The candidate was also provided relevant blood tests results and ECG which they were to interpret and incorporate in a brief formulation of the case. Candidates generally found this to be a difficult station. Examiner feedback indicated that although candidates were often able to take an adequate history they had more difficulty with the physical examination and noted that many MOSCE candidates did not seem prepared to perform a physical examination at all. A number of candidates struggled to use the sphygmomanometers, which were checked throughout the day and were all in perfect working order. Interpretation of the ECG was poor in both the OSCE and MOSCE cohorts. 
\f1\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 2 
\f2 was the \'91Consent\'92 (Consent/Capacity/Communication) station with the additional Blueprint descriptor of \'91Other\'92 (Psychotherapy). The task was to conduct a therapeutic interview with a 35 year old woman focused on assessing her suitability with psychotherapy in the setting in a community mental health centre. The candidate was asked to provide a recommendation to the patient on the role of psychotherapy for her and include discussion of both general factors for suitability for any psychotherapy and specific factors for suitability for long term/psychodynamic psychotherapy. Examiner feedback noted that although candidates appeared to understand the task this did not translate to a satisfactory performance for many. It was noted that a number of candidates used a too much technical jargon to the patient in their explanations. 
\f1\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 3 
\f2 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Anxiety/Somatoform Disorders\'92. The was primarily a diagnostic station with the task being to take a relevant focused history from a 29 year old man presenting to an Emergency Department worried that he was going bald. The candidate was asked to discuss their findings with the patient including the most likely differential diagnoses. In this scenario the patient history and symptoms were most consistent with Body Dysmorphic Disorder. Examiner feedback included observation that a number of candidates in both OSCE and MOSCE cohorts did not appear to read the relevant detail provided in the vignette which then affected their performance. In addition, a number of candidates did not appear to take the patient\'92s primary complaint of losing his hair seriously and often did not attempt to look at his hair. 
\f1\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 4 
\f2 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Personality Disorders\'92. The task was to make a personality assessment of a 25 year old man in an Emergency Department who was accompanying his girlfriend who presented with an overdose following an argument. The candidate was required to inform the Examiner of their findings which were consistent with an Antisocial Personality Disorder with some narcissistic and borderline traits. Examiner feedback again included issues of candidates not appearing to read the instructions and therefore not being clear about their task. In particular, a number of candidates thought they were to take a collateral history from the patient\'92s boyfriend regarding the patient\'92s personality. It was noted that few candidates attempted to take a developmental or family history.

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 5 
\f2 was aligned to the \'91Organic/Neuropsychiatric Disorders\'92 Blueprint descriptor. In this station the Examiner played the role of a Medical Student in the setting of a community clinic and the candidate was required to conduct two tasks. The first task was to explain to the Medical Student the role and function of the Frontal lobes. The second task was to demonstrate on a 65 year old patient (who had a closed head injury 6 months earlier) a number of screening tests of Frontal lobe function, with commentary to the Medical Student including an explanation of the testing procedure, domains being assessed and the expected normal results. Examiner feedback noted that some candidates did not read the instructions thoroughly and therefore omitted the first task. The OSCE cohort performance was much better than the MOSCE and it was observed that in the later group demonstration of adequate testing technique was often lacking eg ceasing the Luria after 2 movements. 
\f1\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 6 
\f2 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Substance Disorders\'92. The scenario was of a 29 year old female patient with a history of morphine use admitted to an acute psychiatry inpatient unit the previous day with depression and suicidal ideation. The task involved taking a history to clarify if she was suffering from Opiate Withdrawal and then to communicate their findings and management plan to the patient. Both OSCE and MOSCE cohorts generally performed well in this station 
\f1\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 7 
\f2 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Mood Disorders\'92. The task was to address the concerns about ECT to a 40 year old female inpatient who had already consented to and was about to commence ECT. The candidate was specifically told to address her concerns and provide information about practical details of ECT and the likely cognitive sequelae. In this station the OSCE cohort performed significantly better than the MOSCE. Examiners feedback noted the MOSCE candidates tended to communicate and engage less well with the patient with respect to addressing her uncertainty and concerns and at times took a more \'91lecturing\'92 stance. It was noted that in both groups of candidates, few acknowledged cognitive impairment as part of Major Depressive Disorder. 
\f1\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 8 
\f2 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Mood Disorders\'92 (Mood/Psychotic/Personality Disorders). The task was to provide information to the non-identical twin sister of a patient with Bipolar Affective Disorder, about how the illness was likely to affect her sister, and what she can do to help prevent relapse. The candidates were also asked to provide the sister information about her own genetic risk. Examiner feedback noted that candidates tended to struggle with giving details about the level of genetic risk. The OSCE cohort performed much better in this station than the MOSCE, the later generally struggled more with time management. The MOSCE candidates were expected to mention issues with respect to possible future pregnancies and peri-natal issues and of interest this tended not to be considered by the male MOSCE candidates. 
\f1\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 9 
\f2 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Ethics\'92 (Ethics/Collaboration/Advocacy). In this station the candidate was required to discuss with a Case Manager in a community mental health clinic, her concerns about a patient with Borderline Personality Disorder who had expressed ideas about killing her brother. The candidate was required to provide to the Case Manager an initial management plan. The essence of this station was of conducting an appropriate risk assessment and making a decision about warning the potential victim. Although this station was generally performed well by the OSCE cohort the examiners were surprised that few trainees mentioned that they would talk to their supervisor (or consult with others) as part of their management plan in this particular clinical situation. 
\f1\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 10 
\f2 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Psychotic Disorders\'92. The task for the candidate was to explain the diagnosis of Schizophrenia to the parent of a newly diagnosed patient (a 20 year old male) and address their concerns. The setting for this scenario was in a general psychiatric outpatient service with the patient having recently been discharged from an Acute Inpatient and was now living at home with his family. Examiner feedback noted that a significant number of candidates did not read the instructions clearly and had presumed that the father already knew of the diagnosis. It was observed that the MOSCE candidates often did not discuss supports that could be available to the father and family. 
\f1\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 1 
\f2 was the \'91Medical Disorders in Psychiatry\'92 station with the additional Blueprint descriptor of \'91Psychotic Disorders\'92. The task was to assess for and propose management for medication induced abnormal involuntary movements in a man with Chronic Schizophrenia on a depot antipsychotic. The patient had tardive dyskinesia, as well as mild parkinsonism and intermittent symptoms of akathisia.

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 2 
\f2 was the \'91Child and Adolescent Disorders\'92 station with the additional Blueprint descriptor of \'91Personality Disorders\'92. The task was to interview the mother of a 14 yr old girl who had been self-cutting and who had Borderline Personality traits and to develop a management plan with specific strategies which would assist the family to manage the behaviours. Candidates generally found this to be a difficult station. It was noted that candidates who performed poorly often did not acknowledge the aspects of risk or it\'92s management; did not discuss in any detail the impact of stigma; did not involve the family in any meaningful way; and frequently did not follow the tasks as outlined.. 
\f1\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 3 
\f2 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor of \'91Organic/Neuropsychiatric Disorders\'92. The task was to explain the diagnosis of Lewy Body Dementia to the wife of 79 yr old patient suffering from this disorder, and to outline guidance and recommendations about his management and prognosis. 
\f1\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 4 
\f2 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Capacity\'92 from the category \'91Capacity/Consent/Communicator\'94. This was a viva station where the candidate was presented with 2 questions based on the management and ethical issues raised by an underweight 17 yr old patient undergoing refeeding for acute Anorexia Nervosa on a medical ward, who wishes to self discharge. In this scenario the candidate was in the position of a Consultation Liaison Psychiatrist. 
\f1\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 5 
\f2 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Mood Disorders\'92. The task involved the candidate teaching aspects of ECT to a Medical Student (played by the Examiner). Specifically, on a manikin the candidate was required to demonstrate the preparation of the skin, and the various placement positions for the stimulus electrodes, as well as explaining the advantages and disadvantages for each of these electrode positions. Despite the task being one that should be familiar to candidates, candidates had the most difficulty with this station. Examiner feedback indicated that candidates generally were able to perform the theory components well but were not able to manage the practical task, particularly by not approaching this task systematically. 
\f1\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 6 
\f2 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Collaboration\'92 from the category \'91Ethics/Collaboration/Advocacy\'92. In this station the candidate was required to provide information to a rural GP about treatment resistant depression including the definition, possible causes, biological treatment options, and advise regarding when to refer on. A number of candidates did not incorporate issues that might arise with respect that this was a \'91rural\'92 GP into their discussions 
\f1\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 7 
\f2 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Mood Disorder\'92 from the category \'91Psychotic/Mood/Personality Disorders\'92. In this station, the Roleplayer was a 55 yr old man with a history of treated PTSD and Depression who had complaints of sexual dysfunction. The candidate was required to explain to the patient the possible causes of his sexual dysfunction and to outline a management plan.. 
\f1\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 8 
\f2 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Other\'92 and included aspects of Clinical Governance, Supervision, Leadership and Administrative Psychiatry. This was a viva type station with 2 questions regarding the management (both immediate as well as medium term management) of a critical incident. The critical incident was of an assault of the candidate\'92s Registrar by a patient in an inpatient psychiatric unit. 
\f1\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 9 
\f2 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Anxiety Disorders\'92. The task was to explain the diagnosis of Generalised Anxiety Disorder to a 43 yr old woman (played by a Roleplayer), with discussion and negotiation of treatment options. 
\f1\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 10 
\f2 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Substance Disorders\'92. The task was to teach a Psychiatric Registrar (played by the Examiner) about Wernickes-Korsakoff\'92s syndrome. This station was structured as a 2 question viva station. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 1 
\f2\b0 was the \'91Medical Disorders in Psychiatry\'92 station with the additional blueprint descriptor of \'91Organic/Neuropsychiatric Disorders\'92. The task was to assess, by history and physical examination, a patient with well controlled schizophrenia in a community mental health setting who presented with headaches. The candidate was also required to inform the examiner of the most likely diagnosis and differential diagnoses and propose what investigations or referrals they would consider. Examiners feedback noted that candidates performed the cranial nerve examination well however many candidates missed the differential of sleep apnoea. Candidates are reminded of the importance of hand washing as part of the physical examination. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 2 
\f2\b0 was the \'91Capacity\'92 (Capacity/Consent/Communication) station with the additional Blueprint descriptor of \'91Other\'92. The task was to assess a patient with chronic renal failure, on dialysis, who was requesting discharge against medical advice from a medical ward. The candidates were assessed to offer a formulation-like statement to the examiners encompassing their thoughts about why the patient was seeking discharge as well as the candidate\'92s assessment of the patient\'92s capacity in this regard. Examiner feedback included that a number of candidates did not put themselves into the consultation-liaison role or outline their role. A brief cognitive screening examination was a common omission. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 3 
\f2\b0 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Collaboration\'92 (Ethics/Collaboration/Advocacy). The task was to collaborate with a GP (played by the examiner) in a rural/remote area to develop a CBT programme for a specific phobia \'96 fear of flying. The candidate was also prompted to advice on what to do if difficulties arose when conducting the programme. Overall, candidates in both the OSCE and MOSCE cohorts performed reasonably well. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 4 
\f2\b0 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Psychotic Disorders\'92. The primary task was to provide an outline and key messages (content) regarding the assessment and interventions for early psychosis to a group of primary care health practitioners. The secondary task was to describe the key aspects (process) of the lecture preparation. Examiner feedback included that some candidates focused too much on the \'91prodrome\'92 at the expense of \'91early psychosis\'92 itself. The MOSCE cohort found this station more difficult with the Examiners noticing that the candidates performing less well tended to lack organisation with respect to the tasks and became overwhelmed with detailed medical information.

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 5 
\f2\b0 was aligned to the \'91Mood Disorders\'92 Blueprint descriptor. The task was to interview a patient with treatment resistant depression in a psychiatric outpatient setting and to convey the findings to the patient. Not only were there biological aspects to poor treatment response but there were also significant psychosocial aspects (including a conflicted marital relationship). Examiner feedback of those candidates performing less well was the tendency to concentrate on the biological aspects and inadequate exploration of the psychosocial aspects and the absence of indicated psychological treatments. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 6 
\f2\b0 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Personality Disorders\'92. The task involved the candidate to make a brief targeted assessment of personality in a woman told to get an assessment because of difficulties in the workplace and then informing the examiner of their findings. The scenario described a Cluster A personality disorder with that of best fit being Schizoid Personality Disorder. Examiner feedback focused on poor time management including wasted time on issues of confidentiality (particularly in the MOSCE cohort). 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 7 
\f2\b0 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Mood Disorders\'92 (Psychotic/Mood/Personality Disorders). The task was to conduct an assessment of risk to self and outline an immediate management plan, including a justified decision about admission to hospital, of a 19yr old pregnant woman in an Emergency Department who has taken an overdose of paracetamol. Examiner feedback included the lack of adequately justified decision about whether to discharge the patient or not. This was thought to be a result of a number of candidates not reading the instructions or being clear on the tasks. It also appeared that candidates\'92 personal values impacted on their approach to managing the patient\'92s desire to terminate the pregnancy. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 8 
\f2\b0 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Child and Adolescent Disorders\'92. The task was to discuss with the examiner the key issues arising from the restraint of an adolescent on a general adult psychiatric inpatient unit. The discussion also needed to include the immediate and medium term management (in the weeks following) as well as dealing with the parents who were angry as a result of their child being injured. Examiner feedback was that candidates focused more on the clinical management aspects of the scenario and not the management of the critical incident and issues of clinical governance. This was particularly noted in the MOSCE cohort who were expected to have had more sophisticated and comprehensive understanding of these issues and processes. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 9 
\f2\b0 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Anxiety Disorders\'92. In this station the candidate was required to assess a patient for possible Panic Disorder (who was convinced she had cardiac pathology) and then explain Panic Disorder to her, assisting her to understand and accept the link between stress and physical symptoms. The patient\'92s father had died of a heart attack three months earlier. Most candidates generally performed well in this station. The examiners feedback of those candidates who performed less well included problems with engaging with a somewhat challenging and resistive patient, and some candidates not picking up on the significance of the father\'92s death and the abnormal blood gases suggesting hyperventilation. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 10 
\f2\b0 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Substance Disorders\'92. The task for the candidate was to obtain relevant collateral history from a patient\'92s husband to confirm the likely diagnosis of Alcohol Withdrawal, and then to explain the management of Alcohol Withdrawal to the husband in an Acute Psychiatry Inpatient unit. Examiner feedback was of that most candidates found time management in this station challenging and that there was a paucity of information about management of alcohol withdrawal offered apart from the use of benzodiazepines and vitamins (general lack of discussion of the role of monitoring, supportive and environmental components in particular). 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2 Station 1 
\f2\b0 instructed candidates to take a focussed history from a foster parent and then link presenting difficulties to a childhood history of trauma and abuse. In the role play, candidates were expected to have empathically engaged with the foster mother. Overall this station was well conducted. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 Station 2 
\f2\b0 focused on a female patient with a history of bipolar affective disorder wanting advice about family planning. Candidates were to take a focussed history from the patient, to answer the patient\'92s questions and explain the risks and benefits of particular management strategies to a patient wanting to start a family or who has discovered they are pregnant. A second task was provided in the examination room to which many candidates had difficulty responding to. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 Station 3 
\f2\b0 asked candidates to sensitively assess the decision making capacity in a patient refusing renal dialysis and convey that information to another health professional. Candidates were expected to establish rapport with the patient in order to undertake an adequate assessment. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 Station 4 
\f2\b0 evaluated candidates on their ability to take a history to support a diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and to clearly explain the diagnosis and treatment options to the patient. Candidates were expected to demonstrate knowledge of the range of biological and psychological treatment options for GAD and evidence the ability to collaboratively develop an appropriate initial treatment plan. While this was a straightforward station some candidates did not demonstrate adequate knowledge of comorbid anxiety and depression. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 Station 5 
\f2\b0 instructed candidates to take a focussed history and conduct risk assessment on a middle aged man with pre-existing personality vulnerabilities now presenting with psychosis and stalking behaviour. They were expected to have undertaken a risk assessment that particularly considered the risk of stalking and to differentiate the personality factors and the psychotic factors that are important in this scenario. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 Station 6 
\f2\b0 was the medical disorders in psychiatry station. Candidates were to demonstrate knowledge and skill in accurately assessing and managing the side effects of lithium in a person with bipolar affective disorder. Candidates were to take a relevant history and review available blood investigations, formulate their findings and to develop an initial plan. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 Station 7 
\f2\b0 was a Modified Viva Station. The scenario asked candidates to prepare a talk which would be presented to the ward nursing staff on how to manage difficult behaviours in patients with personality disorders. Examiners were to evaluate the candidate\'92s ability to understand and communicate the concept of personality disorders and how they affect behaviour. Candidates were also asked to recommend effective ways for nurses to manage interactions with these individuals.

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2 Station 8 
\f2\b0 required the candidate to undertake an assessment of an older person who has benzodiazepine dependence complicated by grief and minimisation. Candidates were assessed on their ability to interview and establish rapport with an older person whose help-seeking behaviours are indirect and whose grief and substance abuse symptoms / behaviours are being minimised. Candidates were to exhibit an awareness of biological, psychological and social factors that impact on the older person and skills in communicating accurate psychiatric diagnosis(es) so that the likelihood of effective intervention is enhanced. Knowledge of benzodiazepine abuse in the elderly was a core feature that candidates needed to focus on. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 Station 9 
\f2\b0 was a Viva Station focusing on clinical governance. In this station candidates were to outline an approach to the clinical and operational management of a serious incident in an adult in-patient unit. They were assessed on their response to this serious incident and the identification of clinical needs of the situation and the identification of organisational needs and processes required for the management of this critical incident.

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 1 
\f2 was a Child and Adolescent station. The main task was to take a history from a community nurse who had concerns about the risks for a child in the context of probable maternal mental illness and to present to the examiners the options for intervention. The main assessment aims of the station were the ability to take a relevant and focussed history from a non-mental health worker; the ability to identify the issues in relation to children who live under the care and protection of a parent with a mental illness, including child protection issues and strengths and factors promoting resilience; the understanding of the key principles in determining what are the options for action and the potential consequences of action, including relevant legislative frameworks and the specific and expert knowledge and a practical approach to the issues involved for children affected by mental illness in a parent.

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This was a difficult station, particularly for the MOSCE candidates. A number of candidates did not fully evaluate the social situation. A colloaborative, biopsychosocial approach was critical in this station, and a number of candidates did not take this approach. As with all stations, there was a number of candidates who did not appear to have properly read the instructions. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 2 
\f2 dealt with the domain of anxiety/somatoform disorders. In this station, candidates were asked to take a focussed history from the patient to confirm a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) of moderate severity. They were asked to discuss and explain the diagnosis and psychological and social aspects of the treatment for OCD to the patient in language that most patients would understand. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This was the best-performed station, with most candidates able to confirm the diagnosis and outline a management plan. Some candidates struggled with social aspects of management and details of psychological management. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 3 
\f2 was a modified viva station. Candidates were asked to explain to a parent about the concepts of fitness to plead, and the potential interactions between schizophrenia and offending and the risk of reoffending. The main assessment aims of this station were the ability to engage with and educate the parent of a patient who has allegedly committed an offence; the knowledge of the concept of fitness to plead \'96 a detailed understanding of specific criteria in the legislation was not required; a knowledge of the association between schizophrenia and offending and the potential relevance of mental illness in court processes. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This station was generally done well, with the first question generally handled better than the second question. Some candidates approached the station as if they were talking to an examiner rather than a parent. OSCE candidates often omitted consultation with their supervisor, and the option of a private forensic assessment was not mentioned by candidates. Structured risk assessment such as HCR-20 was seldom mentioned. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 4 
\f2 directed candidates to take focused history from the carer of patient with possible organic personality disorder/personality disorder secondary to a medical condition and give a broad differential diagnosis. The tasks of this station were to exhibit a proficiency in history taking from the carer (patient\'92s wife) and to provide a differential diagnosis to the carer. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 A number of candidates missed the diagnosis of an organic personality disorder, and few acknowledged carer distress. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 5 
\f2 was the medical station. Candidates were asked to accurately complete the assessment and management of antipsychotic induced side effects \'96 primarily akathisia. Candidates were requested to take a history relevant to the patient\'92s current presenting complaints, undertake a focused physical examination to assess the patient\'92s restlessness and present the most likely cause of the restlessness and the immediate management plans to the examiner. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Most candidates performed adequately, recognsing the akathisia and managing it appropriately. Few mentioned the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale. Only a few candidates highlighted nicotine withdrawal as a possibility. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 6 
\f2 expected candidates to provide information and reassurance to the father of a young woman with recent onset of bipolar disorder. They were to show the ability to empathise with the parent of a young adult with bipolar disorder, particularly in light of elicited family history. The candidates were to exhibit a knowledge of the signs, symptoms, prognosis and acute management of bipolar disorder. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 MOSCE candidates in particular struggled with this station. Many candidates failed to discuss the differential diagnosis, and some failed to take a developmental history relevant to bipolar disorder.

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 7 
\f2 required candidates to demonstrate knowledge of issues related to \'91malingering\'92. They were to use the scenario provided to discuss a diagnostic approach to assessment in a patient. They were to consider a differential diagnoses and to formulate a plan for diagnostic clarification. They were to exhibit the skill of explaining the issues to a junior colleague. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Most candidates failed to point out that malingering was not a psychiatric diagnosis. Some candidates did not adapt their information as if talking to a medical student. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 8 
\f2 asked candidates to discuss with a NGO worker the various aspects of recovery-oriented service delivery in the context of certain restrictive treatment interventions. They were also to display the ability to negotiate effectively and work collaboratively with a worker from an independent organisation in the development of a treatment plan. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 This station proved challenging as the actor had defined questions to ask which reduced the opportunity for interaction. Barriers to treatment were not consistently discussed. Many candidates focussed narrowly on the use of medication in the management plan. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 9 
\f2 expected candidates demonstrate an understanding of personality disorders in general and then with a specific focus on Narcissistic Personality Disorder and the implications for treatment. Candidates were to have a knowledge of the criteria for a diagnosis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder and the suitability and risks of engaging a patient in psychotherapy. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 A number of candidates appeared to misinterpret the instructions in this station; task one had two parts, but many seemed to think it was both tasks, so did not devote sufficient time to the second part of the first task. Other candidates omitted the discussion of what a personality disorder is in general. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f2\fs26\fsmilli13333 A number of candidates had difficulty with identifying the specific risks of this personality type in terms of therapy. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 10 
\f2 was the Substance Disorders station. Candidates were asked to demonstrate their expertise in undertaking a brief alcohol intervention using motivational interviewing skills and strategies with a patient and the ability to engage with a patient in a manner that encourages their willing participation in an attempt to shift them into action. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f4\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 1 
\f5\b0 was the \'91Child and Adolescent Disorders\'92 station with the additional Blueprint descriptor of \'91Communication\'92 (Capacity/Consent/Communication). The station was set in a Child and Adolescent outpatient service and the task was to assess via collateral history from the mother, relevant history of school refusal of an 11 year old boy. The candidate was then asked to provide a formulation to the mother and advise regarding management strategies for school refusal and the likely outcome. The OSCE candidates in general performed well. Examiner feedback for the MOSCE candidates indicated that a number of candidates did not appear to have read the instructions well and that the management advice offered tended to be generic and was poorly related to this specific clinical scenario. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f4\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 2 
\f5\b0 was the \'91Psychotic Disorders\'92 station with the additional Blueprint descriptor of \'91Personality Disorders\'92. The task was to interview a 17 year old girl, in a community youth mental health service, to establish possible diagnoses. The candidate was asked to answer two questions, the first was in regard of the diagnosis and differential diagnosis, and the second was in regard the candidate\'92s initial management plan. In this scenario the patient had a probably personality disorder with some features consistent with risk of psychosis. The OSCE cohort performed much better in this station than the MOSCE, the later generally struggled more with time management both in respect to taking the history as well in the areas of discussing diagnoses and management. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f4\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 3 
\f5\b0 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Mood Disorders\'92. The scenario was set within a community mental health service. The candidate was presented with two HoNOS (Health of the Nations Outcomes Scale) scores for a 27year old female patient; the first one 8 months previously and the second taken earlier that day by the patient\'92s Case Manager. The candidate was required to review and clarify the changes in symptom and function with the patient, as well as to prioritise and discuss possible interventions. Examiner feedback expressed surprise and concern that within both groups of candidates it appeared that candidates do not routinely use the HoNOS in their clinical practice and this translated into poor performance in this station particularly for the MOSCE candidates. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f4\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 4 
\f5\b0 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Other\'92 (Sleep Disorders). The scenario was set within a Sleep Disorders Clinic as part of a consultation-liaison rotation. The task was to interview a 21 year old male patient regarding their insomnia complaint and then to explain their understanding of the problem to the patient. Examiner feedback included many candidates did not introduce their consult-liaison role and a number presented management plans when this was expressively not a required task. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f4\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 5 
\f5\b0 was aligned to the \'91Organic/Neuropsychiatric Disorders\'92 Blueprint descriptor. In this station the Examiner played the role of a Medical Student in the setting of a community mental health clinic and the candidate was required to conduct two tasks. The first task was to explain to the Medical Student the role and function of the Parietal lobes. The second task was to demonstrate on a 40 year old patient (who had a closed head injury 2 years earlier) a number of screening tests of Parietal lobe function, with commentary to the Medical Student including an explanation of the testing procedure, domains being assessed and the expected normal results. In this station the MOSCE cohort overall performed extremely well. Examiner feedback for the OSCE cohort indicated some candidates did not clearly identify the roles of the examiner and the role-player which affected their performance. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f4\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 6 
\f5\b0 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Substance Disorders\'92. The scenario was set within a youth early psychosis service within a community mental health centre. The candidate was presented the case of a 19 year old male patient with a history of recent admission for first episode psychosis also with a history of cannabis use. After the admission, the patient had initially been abstinent from cannabis use however he had begun using again in an increasing pattern. The candidate was told that the patient was ambivalent about his substance use but had started to worry about the potential impact on him. The tasks were to take a focused drug and alcohol history and to assess the patient\'92s motivation for change with regards their substance abuse issues. Finally the candidate was required to present to the examiner a management plan for the patient\'92s substance use including addressing his motivation to change. The OSCE cohort overall performance was much better than the MOSCE and it was observed that the latter generally did better in the \'91approach\'92 and \'91history\'92 aspects but more poorly in the \'91management\'92 part of the station. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f4\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 7 
\f5\b0 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Personality Disorders\'92 (Psychotic/Mood/Personality Disorders). This was primarily a diagnostic station in an outpatient setting, with the task being for the candidate to take a relevant focused history from a 68 year old female patient with compulsive hoarding. The candidate was then required to discuss with the examiner the most likely diagnosis and differential diagnosis. The preferred diagnosis was that of Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder, with differentials including Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Alcohol Dependence, and a range of other anxiety disorders. The MOSCE cohort found this station particularly difficult with the examiner feedback indicating that many candidates struggled across all aspects of the station

\f4\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Station 8 
\f5\b0 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Medical Disorders in Psychiatry\'92. The first task was to elicit symptoms relating to movement disorders secondary to antipsychotic medication in a 38 year old male patient in an outpatient setting. The second task was to undertake a focused physical examination assessing for side effects of medications whilst giving a commentary to the examiner, before finally presenting a diagnosis and differential diagnoses to the examiner. The primary diagnosis sought was that of lower facial Tardive Dyskinesia with additional diagnoses being that of Parkinsonism and intermittent dose-related Akathisia. In general, both groups of candidates performed well in this station. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f4\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 9 
\f5\b0 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Anxiety and Somatoform Disorders\'92. In this station the candidate was put in the position of providing a teaching session on the topic of dissociation (to medical students for the OSCE cohort and psychiatry trainees for the MOSCE cohort). The station had two specific tasks which the candidate could do in either order: the first was to explain to the examiner the content of the talk regarding the concept of dissociation and its historical and diagnostic significance; and the second task was to outline to the examiner how they would prepare for and conduct the teaching session. Examiner feedback noted that both groups of candidates performed better in discussing how they would prepare and conduct the teaching session. Both the OSCE and MOSC candidates struggled with regards discussing the content of talk and the MOSCE cohort in general did not appear to have a broad understanding of this clinical concept (or be able to explain it). 
\f1\fs24 \

\f4\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 Station 10 
\f5\b0 was aligned to the Blueprint descriptor \'91Ethics\'92 (Ethics/Collaboration/Advocacy).This was a viva station with two questions relating to the scenario within a community clinic of a 39 year old woman with schizophrenia, on clozapine, with a number of psychosocial issues who was wanting to apply for IVF. The first question to outline to potential risks to the patient\'92s mental health and to her foetus/infant if IVF goes ahead; the second question enquired about ethical issues that were raised in the scenario. The MOSCE cohort did performed better in this station than the OSCE however examiner feedback indicated that both groups of candidates had difficulties in discussing the ethical issues and in particular relating them to the case. Time management was also noted to be a challenge for some candidates especially as it related to the first question where a number of issues needed to be covered in the first four minutes.
