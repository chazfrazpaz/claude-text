The Child and Adolescent Mental Health team where youwork as a psychiatrist has been treating her for a year, but you have not been responsible for her care untilnow. Tanisha is mute, both when seen at the clinic and at school, but her mother says that she talks athome. She has been diagnosed with selective mutism, and treated with Sertraline by your predecessor, upto 150mg/day, which she has tolerated well. Your service has attempted to engage with Tanisha to provideindividual and group psychotherapy on several occasions over the last year, but she has refused to attendthe appointments. Her mother has attended a psychoeducation group for parents, focussed on anxietydisorders. The onset of Tanisha's anxiety and mutism was reported to be after a fire in the family homefrom which they were evacuated, when she was 6 years old. Due to there being no significant improvementin her anxiety or mutism you have been asked to discharge Tanisha from the clinic, and so you arereviewing her case record.Question 5.1 (7 marks)Outline (list and justify) the key areas you would want to explore in Tanisha's case record.Please note: a list with no justification will not receive any marks.worth mark(circle)A.Developmental History: particularly looking for developmental delays andrepetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities – to help clarify herdiagnosis and any ASD symptoms2012B.Educational Performance and IQ: school attendance and her academicfunctioning (as a rough estimate of IQ), and look for any more detailed IQtesting – to help clarify the severity of her disorder and the diagnosis2012C.Social Functioning: information from parents and teachers regarding hersocial skills – to clarify the severity of her disorder, the diagnosis, and anyASD symptoms1 01D.Anxiety Symptoms: e.g. re PTSD given the fire in the family home, or re otheranxiety disorders like Separation Anxiety, GAD, Phobias, SAD, and anyfunctional impairment due to anxiety – to help clarify the diagnosis2012E. Family History: especially regarding mood, anxiety, or neurodevelopmentaldisorders – to help clarify the diagnosis regarding inherited risks 1 01F. Mood Symptoms: to clarify the diagnosis – i.e. to rule out a mood disorder asa differential or comorbid condition 1 01G.Risk Assessment: risk to self, others and regarding her self-care, but also therisk to her social and emotional development – essential to check risks beforeconsidering discharge1 01Up to a maximum of 7 marks in totalTOTAL:Note to Examiners: Final mark is set at not more than 7.

You obtainthe psychology report to review this further, and note that Tanisha was mute at the time when she wasassessed with standardised psychometrics.Question 5.2 (4 marks)Describe (list and explain) the issues to consider in making a diagnosis of intellectual disability inTanisha, given that she was mute during psychometric testing.Please note: a list with no explanation will not receive any marks.worth mark(circle)A.History of intellectual functioning:A valid diagnosis of ID can be made if there is a history of significant deficitsin intellectual functioning – e.g. in reasoning, problem solving, planning,learning from experience etc., even when the disability precludesstandardised intelligence testing2012B.History of adaptive functioning:A valid diagnosis of ID can be made if there is a history of significant deficitsin adaptive functioning that cause developmental delays in personalindependence and social functioning, even when the disability precludesstandardised intelligence testing2012C.Consider the timing of the onset of disability:The time of onset of the intellectual and adaptive deficits needs to beconsidered. If this was during her developmental period it would pre-date thehouse fire so a developmental disorder would be more likely, rather than atraumatic response to the house fire causing mutism1 01D.Consider Austism Spectrum Disorder:The likelihood of developmental disorders such as ASD is higher in peoplewho have ID, therefore this may need to be considered as an alternativeexplanation of some of her symptoms like the mutism, rather than the mutismbeing due to anxiety1 01Up to a maximum of 4 marks in totalTOTAL:Note to Examiners: Final mark is set at not more than 4.

If these are causing concern,would her family want Tanisha to have an increased dose to see if that helps,or to trial an alternative SSRI, e.g. fluoxetine – does she really needmedication, and if so, important to maximise the efficacy of any medication2012D.Check what past practical and psycho-social interventions have beenorganised already, e.g. supports, and whether these have helped. Also checkif Tanisha's mother accessed these – need to know what else was tried and ifmore support's needed, in case this might reduce the need for medication1 01E.Discuss with her mother that developmental disorders such as ASD caninclude significant anxiety that's worth treating, and about the pros and consof Sertraline or other options – need to explain about anxiety linked with ASDto Tanisha's family so they can make informed decisions2012Up to a maximum of 4 marks in totalTOTAL:Note to Examiners: Final mark is set at not more than 4.

Your registrar, Tom, hasbeen to assess Richard, an 83-year-old man who was discharged to a residential care facility from amedical ward two weeks ago, having been diagnosed with a left external capsule infarct. He also has adiagnosis of dementia which was made prior to his stroke. Richard was previously living at home with hiswife, Emily, who provided round-the-clock care for him.The residential care facility asked the local General Practitioner (GP) for help as Richard is difficult tomanage. They say he constantly tries to get out of bed, is a falls risk and often takes off all his clothes. TheGP started Richard on quetiapine and lorazepam with little improvement in these behaviours. The GP andthe residential care facility want advice from your mental health service on what other medications may behelpful to manage Richard’s behaviour.The nursing co-ordinator insists that Richard is not manageable at the residential care facility as he isconstantly getting out of bed at night and needs a 1:1 watch, which is an expense for them.(PTO for model answers)30Question 6.1 (10 marks)Outline (list and justify) the key information that you would expect Tom to have gathered from thestaff and from Richard's records, at the residential care facility.Please note: a list with no justification will not receive any marks.worth mark(circle)A.Details about the presenting complaint – the disruptive behaviour (need toclarify the problem and make a diagnosis):• Duration and pattern of symptoms and an ABC (antecedents, behaviourand consequences) understanding of them, e.g. how does the care facilitymanage the disruptive behaviour• History of similar behaviour from his records, given his dementia diagnosis• Efficacy of the medications for his behaviour, and any adverse effects2012B.Delirium screening (need to rule out delirium causing his behaviour)• Check for features indicative of delirium like a recent onset of the changes,fluctuating behaviours, fluctuating level of consciousness and attention,visual illusions or hallucinations, etc.• Check for possible causes of delirium and what examinations orinvestigations have been done – e.g. blood tests, MSU, physical exam,routine observations, any signs of pain, infection, constipation. Check forany medication change as a cause for delirium – e.g. anticholinergicmedications2012C.Check Richard's general functioning (to check possible causes of stress)• Check his ADLs (feeding, bathing, grooming, dressing, bowels, bladder,toilet use, mobility)• Are sensory or communication deficits contributing to aggressive behaviourlike poor hearing or vision, or aphasia after his stroke?2012D.Environmental and social factors (to check possible causes of stress)• Are environmental factors making matters worse – like excessive noise,overstimulation (stress), understimulation (boredom), lack of routine orrecent routine changes, understaffing or overworked staff, etc.• Has Richard had visits from his family or similar supports2012E.Psychiatric disorder screening (checking differentials or comorbidities)• Check for symptoms of psychosis – delusions or hallucinations• Check for an anxiety or mood disorder. Does he seem depressed, has heexpressed suicidal ideas?• Check his past history of any psychiatric disorder• Check his substance use history – rule out substance withdrawal2012F.Risk assessment (important to assess how risky the situation is)• Any aggression by Richard towards the staff or residents• Does he express suicidal ideation or a passive death wish.

His wife has been bringing him music to listen to, but the staff feel it is “unsuitable” as itmight disrupt the other residents in the care facility. Richard spends most of the day in his room as he oftenshouts profanities.Tom wishes to increase Richard’s quetiapine to 50mg three times daily (from 12.5mg three times daily) asthis is what the residential care facility has requested. He raises this plan with you in supervision today.Question 6.2 (8 marks)Describe (list and explain) what you would want to discuss with Tom regarding non-pharmacological management planning in Richard's case.Please note: a list with no explanation will not receive any marks. worth mark(circle)A.General approach to determining Richard's management plan• Important to collaborate with Richard (as far as possible), and with hisfamily, and the care facility staff, to develop a person-centred plan• Need to acknowledge the concerns and frustrations of the staff• Need to acknowledge that non-pharmacological management's usually usedtogether with pharmacological management in the residential care setting2012B.Consider environmental improvements• Richard may be bored – try activity scheduling with an activity planfocussing on music, hobbies etc. as a diversion and to reduce agitation• Various forms of sensory modulation may help – music therapy,aromatherapy, reducing excessive noise, etc.• As he loves music, Richard could possibly use headphones to listen tomusic selected by him and his wife• Personalise his room and display signs that aid his orientation2012C.Psychological interventions that might assist• Validation therapy – acknowledging Richard's feelings in the here and nowas ‘real’ to him, irrespective of the actual reality• Reminiscence therapy – to stimulate memory using his life history1 01D.Improve his sleep hygiene• Patients with dementia often have sleep difficulties due to physical problemsor environmental change. A sleep diary kept by the staff might clarify anyissues and suggest ways to intervene1 01E.Behavioural management of Richard's agitation• Need to work closely with the residential care facility staff regarding this, andprovide education to the staff• Use the ABC model (the staff document antecedents, the behaviour and theconsequences) to understand the problem behaviours• Review the ABC record with the staff, to determine how the frequency andseverity of his problem behaviours could be reduced• Implement that plan, continue the ABC record, then review again, etc.30123F.Practical interventions – staffing, where to treat him• Review the need for 1:1 staffing – could it be used less often? Does he haveconsistent carers across the shifts, that he can get to know?• He may need to move to a higher level of care e.g. a dementia care facility1 01Up to a maximum of 8 marks in totalTOTAL:Note to Examiners: Final mark is set at not more than 8.

 MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION                                2  Modified Essay Question 2 (25 marks)  You are phoned by a junior registrar in the early hours of the morning about Damien, aged 32, who is being restrained in the Emergency Department because of aggression and threatening to punch staff. Damien had been brought to the ED by police, having climbed onto the bridge railings of a pedestrian motorway overpass, and having threatened to kill himself by jumping off.  There is a history of poly-substance abuse and intermittent intravenous use of illicit substances. Damien has an established diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder with an extensive criminal history dating back to age 16, including violent offences. Due to Damien's aggression and lack of co-operation the registrar has been unable to interview him. However,  similar presentations in the past have resulted in brief involuntary admissions, with Damien having been released after several days 'without evidence of a mental disorder'. The registrar suggests this presentation is 'bad behaviour' rather than 'mental illness' and is asking your opinion on discharging Damien.  Question 2.1 (7 marks)  Outline what would need to be assessed before Damien could be safely discharged.                                                                                                     mark                                                                                           worth                                                                                                     (circle)              Risk assessment to ensure he's safe for discharge.

Modified Essay Question 2 Damien is admitted under the Mental Health Act to the acute psychiatric unit. The police request a copy of the psychiatric assessment, and ask to be informed when Damien is released so that they can arrest him. Question 2.2 (5 marks) Outline the ethical and legal issues arising from the police requests, and how you might address these.                                                                                                  mark                                                                                        worth                                                                                                 (circle)       Key Ethical issues:           Autonomy - regarding Damien's right for confidentiality of health information       .

Need to fully disclose the need to share information with the police prior to          assessment/treatment commencing, and you should only inform the police with          Damien's written informed consent if he's competent.       · BUT (non-maleficence) - need to weigh up the above against Damien's mental                 0 A        state to ensure you don't increase his risks by full disclosure if he's not competent 3   1          to take part in decisions.                                                                2       . Need to weigh up the various risks - the need to respect Damien's autonomy must            3          be balanced against autonomy of others. i.e. degree of risk from Damien to the          safety of others. This could outweigh the need to maintain his confidentiality.       NB: there are of course issues of Beneficence in the need to treat Damien, but these       are not relevant to the exact question above so they gain no marks if mentioned.       NB: also, candidates may mention Justice as there are legal issues, but 'justice' in       Ethical Principles terms is a different matter and if mentioned, gains no marks.       Relevant Legislation includes:       · Privacy Act                                                                                0 B     · Mental Health Act                                                                2         1       · Criminal Justice Act (Damien might be on parole or bail, which could place clinician       2          under obligation to advise the police of his whereabouts)       Challenging nature of case - how you might address this: C     .

Modified Essay Question 3 You learn that Ella has been feeling empty and low since starting high school at age 13. She took the overdose when distressed about the break up of a 3 week relationship with a 17 year old boy who she thought she would eventually marry. At the time of the overdose she wished to die, but she also texted him and several friends to "show them what he'd done to me". She has previously taken two other overdoses, both in the context of stressors. She cuts herself about twice-weekly and has previously also burnt herself with matches so as to "feel something". Her GP has prescribed fluoxetine to a maximum dose of 40mg which she reports being compliant with but says doesn't help. Her sleep and appetite are intact. She has supportive parents who have been concerned about her for some time. Her mother reports she was sexually abused by a neighbour between ages 7 - 9 (for which the neighbour has been incarcerated) and that she was bullied at primary school for being slightly overweight and wearing glasses. Question 3.2 (4 marks) Outline (list and justify) the most likely differential diagnoses at this point.                                                                                                       Mark                                                                                            worth                                                                                                      (circle)                                                                                                         0  A.

 MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION 5 Modified Essay Question 5: (23 marks)  You are a junior consultant working in an outpatient assertive engagement service. Stephen is a 46 year old unemployed man with a 15 year history of psychotic illness, including seven inpatient admissions. He normally lives with 2 flatmates in a complex of social housing units. He is treated compulsorily via the Mental Health Act, on a long-term community treatment order. He has a history of assault and of assault with a weapon, which occurred 13 years earlier.  Since his last inpatient admission 3 years ago, Stephen has been under the care of the assertive engagement community mental health team. For much of this time his mental state has been at baseline, which includes a chronic but vague sense of paranoia plus auditory hallucinations characterised as voices that talk to him. The content of his auditory hallucinations has been generally persecutory, occasionally giving him instructions. Generally he has not been overly troubled by these symptoms, and has had no difficulty resisting the hallucinatory instructions.  Over the course of his illness, Stephen has had a number of diagnoses, but most consistently schizophrenia plus an underlying antisocial personality disorder. He also has a past history of cannabis dependence (says he last used this five years earlier) and sporadic polysubstance abuse. Over the previous three years there has been no evidence of mood disorder. Since his last inpatient admission he has been prescribed olanzapine 20mg and risperidone 2mg at night. Over the four weeks before you see Stephen, his female case manager has reported that Stephen has become gradually more paranoid than usual. In addition, Stephen has become harder for his case manager to locate in the previous two weeks and he appears not to have been staying at his unit.  Stephen has also isolated himself from friends. The night before you see Stephen, he was arrested for trespassing on private property after a member of the public reported seeing somebody with a flashlight inside a half-built house at midnight. The police say he's been irritable and uncooperative, and has not given a coherent account of his actions. P.T.O. for Question 5.1                                                                                                 20 <<<

Or he might be strongly opposed to a depot.              1       Clarify reason(s) for non-adherence to oral antipsychotic treatment. Might include                                                                                                        0       adverse effects or lack of efficacy (in which case you could try another oral agent) or           1 B                                                                                            2       could be lack of insight into need for treatment.

As Stephen is subject to compulsory       treatment, treatment with depot antipsychotic may be enforced if he declines this and if                                                                                                        0       it is considered to be in Stephen's best interests.

When unwell, he's also likely to present a risk of violence towards staff trying       to give injections. Consider day-stay treatment or an admission to monitor depot       treatment, if needed. Admission either to acute unit or a rehab facility if one's available.       Consider practical issues relating to administration of depot antipsychotic. What       facilities and staff are available to administer injections? If he won't attend the clinic is    0 D     it safe to give in his home? Deltoid administration might be preferable to buttock     2          1       administration for injections in his home. Facilities to watch for post-injection sedation       2       syndrome may be needed if olanzapine's used (e.g. consider admission or day-stay).       Weigh up the risks vs benefits overall. Evaluate the above factors, especially his likely        0 E     degree of cooperation and the administration risks and practicalities, versus the risk if 1                                                                                                         1       he remains non-compliant with oral medication and relapses more seriously.                                                            Up to a maximum of 6 marks in total                                                                                           TOTAL:      Note to Examiners: Final mark is set at not more than 6.

Six hours have passed since the overdose. She does not need treatment with N- acetylcysteine and has been "medically cleared for discharge" by the ED. Rebecca is 28 weeks pregnant with her first child. She has a history of intravenous drug use and is followed-up by the local Addictions service. She's prescribed Methadone 60mg daily which is dispensed by her pharmacy each day. On interview, Rebecca describes a four month history of depressive symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. She has not been treated in the past for depression and there is no previous history of deliberate self harm or attempted suicide. Rebecca is unable to give a clear account of the overdose but denies continuing suicidal ideation. She claims to have little memory of taking the overdose. She appears somewhat drowsy, there is some slurring of her speech, and nursing staff report that she is a little unsteady on her feet.

Has that extreme expectation led to the  logical argument, and most or all the  arguments are relevant.                             culture of "health blame" we have today, where people are seen as                                                      personally responsible for their mental and physical health: i.e. if only they                                                      had meditated more or been more mindful, or gone to the gym more, they                                                      wouldn't have developed cancer or depression, etc. The Recovery                                                      principles can usefully be raised here, as these emphasise the importance                                                      of well-being and productivity even if the symptoms of a mental disorder                                                      are not fully resolved.

Modified Essay Question 3 contd. Abigail proves to be intoxicated with alcohol. She is found a bed in a short-stay unit off the main ED where she is monitored by nursing staff. She falls asleep and wakes six hours later at 4 a.m., presenting as sober. The nurse tells you they have learned Abigail was being cared for by a babysitter and drank wine from an open cask in the kitchen, unbeknownst to the babysitter who eventually called an ambulance after Abigail became intoxicated. The nurse says there was some difficulty locating her parents, but they are now driving in and are expected in about an hour. Abigail is tired and somewhat embarrassed but no longer wants to die and is medically cleared for discharge. Your review does not reveal any history of mental illness including depression or past suicide attempts. Abigail says she has tried alcohol before "a few times".

Stephen is a 22 year old man with a known history of paranoid schizophrenia, who at the time of admission was under the care of an Early Intervention Team. Stephen self-presented the previous night to the Emergency Department in distress, reporting his stepfather wanted to kill him. After one of the ED doctors had taken a blood sample from him, Stephen believed this signalled he would die within two hours. He subsequently fled from the ED department whilst awaiting a psychiatric assessment. One hour later he allegedly assaulted a passer-by, without provocation.

Modified Essay Question 4 contd. On reviewing the notes, you find that Stephen presented with his first psychotic episode two years earlier (age 20). He became suspicious about his stepfather, with whom he lived, and left home due to fears for his safety. He had been using cannabis heavily since age 18. He had no previous history of violence or criminal convictions. He had been studying agriculture at university but left the course 6 months before his first psychotic episode. He responded well to olanzapine 10mg daily which he took for 18 months. Six months ago he lost his job on a farm, recommenced smoking cannabis, was sporadic in his medication adherence and disengaged from the Early Intervention Team (this service was in the process of discharging him at the time of his admission). On assessment, Stephen reported feeling safe from his stepfather as he could not be "got at" in hospital, although he remained fearful of him, especially if he were to be released. He denied any auditory hallucinations. His mother informed you that Stephen had been well until 10 days before admission, since which time he had been spending more time away from home. He had gone missing for two days before the index offence. Stephen accepted oral olanzapine on admission and was nursed in the high care area for three days without incident. He was subsequently transferred to the open ward, but assaulted another patient the following morning after seeing this patient talking on the phone. Stephen believed this patient had made contact with his stepfather and had been instructed to kill him. Both Stephen and the other patient are under your care. Question 4.2     (8 marks) Outline (list and elaborate) your management of this critical incident.                                                                                                 mark                                                                                      worth                                                                                                (circle)        Immediate management regarding the assault:        ·   Ensure immediate safety of patients and staff with environmental and/or                0           pharmacological restraint                                                               1   A.                                                                                   3        ·   Accurate information gathering and documentation - details of assault,                 2           last mental state, incident reporting                                                   3        · Communication - with family, clinical director, police        Assessment of Stephen and Risk Management:        · Mental state examination, specifically suspicious thoughts towards others           in ward, level of fear, extent of violent thoughts.                                     0   B.   · Medication review - check compliance, consider need for dose increment        3          1                                                                                                   2           or of depot antipsychotic, consider short-term anxiolytics                                                                                                   3        ·   Environmental management - consider: managing him away from other           patients, direct observation, nursing ratio for approach, etc.        Assess and Support the Victim:        · Ensure victim is assessed and treated for possible physical injuries                     0        ·   Assess mental state - impact of assault, mood, psychotic and anxiety                   1   C.                                                                                    4         2           symptoms, any desire to retaliate                                                                                                   3        · Ensure victim is receiving support e.g. from nursing staff                               4        ·   Contact victim's family/caregivers to explain, apologise and reassure                                                        Up to a maximum of 8 marks in total                                                                                     TOTAL:      Note to Examiners: Final mark is set at not more than 8.

Modified Essay Question 5 contd. Alison reports Alex has always been hard to settle at night from very young, and seems to her a "night owl". When they were together he would be left in bed and usually settled when his parents went to bed at 10pm. She thinks he has been much more challenging to settle to sleep since the separation and blames this on Simon allowing him to have an iPad in his bedroom. Simon says the iPad helps Alex settle to bed independently. Alison thinks Alex is averaging six hours sleep at night. Question 5.2   (3 marks) Outline (list and elaborate) what you would feed back to Alex's parents about his sleep and night-time routines.                                                                                              mark                                                                                   worth                                                                                             (circle)       Psychoeducation about sleep:                                                                                                0       .

MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION 6 Modified Essay Question 6: (25 marks) You are a consultant psychiatrist at a Community Mental Health Team (CMHT). Jeffrey, an indigenous 48 year old man with a long history of paranoid schizophrenia, is under your care at the CMHT, and under a Compulsory Treatment Order. He has been maintained on a traditional antipsychotic depot for several years. He has a history of co-morbid alcohol and cannabis use but rarely presents to local Mental Health Services or to the police. He attends the CMHT regularly to get his depot. He is often homeless but sometimes stays at a cheap boarding house for a while, or else at the homeless shelter. His support network includes the homeless shelter, a local soup kitchen and various other NGO supports such as a local drop-in centre. Jeffrey has been estranged from his family for some time, but his sister, Claire, recently moved back to the area and has requested a meeting with you. Jeffrey has agreed for you to do this to "get her off my back, but I don't want her meddling with my business". Question 6.1 (7 marks) Outline (list and elaborate) the topics you wish to address with Claire.                                                                                              mark                                                                                   worth                                                                                             (circle)      Approach: A.

MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION 5 Modified Essay Question 5: (18 marks) You are a general adult psychiatrist working in a rural community team. You have been asked by a GP to review Kylie, a 28 year old woman who is 18 weeks pregnant. She is reporting low mood, tearfulness, and poor sleep. The GP tells you she was depressed after the birth of her first child (now aged 3) and overdosed on analgesic medication at that time. She is living with her partner who is the father of the two children, and there is some conflict as he was recently charged with a drink-driving offence. She has recently been to her GP with concerns about 'tantrums' in her 3 year old. Following a comprehensive assessment of Kylie, you conclude that she has a severe depressive disorder and that antidepressant treatment is indicated. You decide to trial an SSRI. Question 5.1 (10 marks) Outline (list and justify) your approach to prescribing for Kylie, including the specific pregnancy- related risks of SSRIs that you would want to discuss.                                                                                                mark                                                                                      worth                                                                                                (circle)       Safety of medication in pregnancy       · Consult with a psychiatrist specialising in perinatal psychiatry re choice of            0         medication and treatment                                                                  1  A.   .

MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION 6 Modified Essay Question 6: (14 marks) You work on a Liaison team and are called to the Emergency Department (ED) to assess Yasmin, a 25 year old Iranian woman brought to hospital from a Women's Refuge, where she had been for 24 hours. She has two children aged 8 and 11, who have remained at the Refuge in the care of the staff. ED staff tell you that she has been badly beaten and has many bruises, and evidence of old fractures to facial bones. They have requested a consult as Yasmin has been largely mute since arrival at ED, often flinching away from staff, especially male staff. At times if left unattended she has gesticulated and muttered to herself and they feel she is confused and disorientated. The Refuge staff member accompanying her was not able to communicate with her while at ED and has had to return to the Refuge. Before leaving she told ED staff that a few hours ago Yasmin's speech and grasp of English seemed reasonable and they had not needed an interpreter. She described Yasmin as initially caring well for her children then becoming more withdrawn and complaining of a headache in the hours before coming to hospital, seeming confused, frightened and at times retching. Refuge staff had been unable to obtain much personal history except that she is married and afraid to return to her husband's household as she says he beats her.

Candidates are advised to aim for well above 50% (60-65% is safer), to allow for that in the actual exam.                                                                                          1 <<<

Modified Essay Question 2 contd.  Joanne reports the obsessional thought that she has done something wrong. She relates this to accidentally viewing pornography when on the internet six months earlier. This obsessional thinking leads to her constantly questioning her actions and being unable to make decisions. There is no other compulsive behaviour. After a thorough assessment, you conclude that Joanne has severe OCD. This has deteriorated since she stopped fluoxetine two weeks earlier due to her obsessional anxiety about doing something wrong.

For example, answer question 1.4 fully, even if you believe you have partly covered its content in your answers to questions 1.2 and 1.3. Modified Essay Question 3: (23 marks) You are a junior consultant psychiatrist working in a Community Mental Health Team. Anton is a 42-year-old man of European descent under your care. He has an 18 year history of paranoid schizophrenia and is currently on clozapine. He is treated compulsorily via the Mental Health Act. He lives alone in rental accommodation, receives long-term social services income due to his illness and is supported by his elderly parents who are retired and live locally. He has no other close family Anton attends your clinic complaining that his neighbours have organised with the police to have him monitored and have installed an internet tracking device on the lamppost outside his flat. Anton reports they did this a year ago under the pretence of having fibre internet installed. He has been isolating himself at home and reports that he has no interest in going out and has lost weight because he is not eating. Anton says he has been more worried about the surveillance devices in the last three months and he can no longer sleep because of the fear. He wants zopiclone to help him sleep and a letter to the council to have the lamppost removed, as otherwise he will have to "take matters into my own hands". Question 3.1 (5 marks) List the potential reasons for Anton's presentation at this point.                                                                                              mark                                                                                   worth                                                                                             (circle) A.

You are assisting with cover as the registrar was overloaded with other assessments.  Abigail has presented to ED twice within the past 3 days, each time with overdoses of 10 paracetamol  tablets. Abigail is well known to the ED with multiple past presentations of self harm including lacerating her  wrists, intoxication and overdose. She has now been medically cleared for discharge from ED. The house  officer's notes say that her current presentation was triggered by conflict with her father with whom she  lives, as Abigail says he does not believe her report of childhood sexual abuse by a neighbour who was a  friend of her father. Her father says Abagail has intense mood swings which are difficult to control or  predict.  Question 6.1 (4 marks)  List the most likely differential diagnoses which might account for her presentation at this point,  based on the above information.                                                                                                 mark                                                                                      worth                                                                                                 (circle)                                                                                                  0 A.

Modified Essay Question 6 contd. A comprehensive management plan which actively discourages admission for Abigail due to a past history of prolonged, difficult admissions with regression, angry acting out, and escalating self-harm, is located in Abigail's records. Abigail's regular follow-up is from a community mental health centre and a private psychotherapist. Abigail is now somewhat calmer and has started talking of staying with a friend overnight, as she's still angry with her father. The private psychotherapist then arrives at the ED and talks with you before seeing Abigail.

Will enforcing this jeopardise     2          1       his future treatment and engagement with services? Needs to be balanced                        2       against the likely consequences of not treating him.       What support and care is available for Jacob if he leaves hospital:       Are his family able to support him and provide accommodation?                                 0       Do his supports understand the nature of psychosis and the risks?                   2          1  D.       Have community respite or intensive home care been considered? - i.e. other                    2       less restrictive treatment options than admission.

The lawyer says that you're well placed to attest to Caleb's good character, which they believe could lessen any sentence or the potential for a prison term. Question 2.3    (4 marks) Describe (list and explain) your response to this request. Please note: a list with no explanation will not receive any marks.                                                                                                  mark                                                                                        worth                                                                                                 (circle)        The request is inappropriate and must be refused.        The explanation for this is:        .   need to maintain boundaries - your prior report was in a court-appointed            role and this lawyer now wants you to act as an expert or character witness            for the defence        .   depending on the local legal framework, it might not be lawful for you to               0            agree to this request                                                                    1   A.   .   you gathered clinical information from Caleb specifically for the purposes of 4         2            the fitness-to-plead report, not so as to act for his defence.

The Child and Adolescent Mental Health team where you work as a psychiatrist has been treating her for a year, but you have not been responsible for her care until  now. Tanisha is mute, both when seen at the clinic and at school, but her mother says that she talks at  home. She has been diagnosed with selective mutism, and treated with Sertraline by your predecessor, up  to 150mg/day, which she has tolerated well. Your service has attempted to engage with Tanisha to provide  individual and group psychotherapy on several occasions over the last year, but she has refused to attend the appointments. Her mother has attended a psychoeducation group for parents, focussed on anxiety disorders. The onset of Tanisha's anxiety and mutism was reported to be after a fire in the family home from which they were evacuated, when she was 6 years old. Due to there being no significant improvement in her anxiety or mutism you have been asked to discharge Tanisha from the clinic, and so you are reviewing her case record.  Question 5.1 (7 marks)  Outline (list and justify) the key areas you would want to explore in Tanisha's case record.  Please note: a list with no justification will not receive any marks.                                                                                               mark                                                                                    worth                                                                                              (circle)      Developmental History: particularly looking for developmental delays and                   0 A.   repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities - to help clarify her 2          1                                                                                                 2      diagnosis and any ASD symptoms      Educational Performance and IQ: school attendance and her academic                         0 B.   functioning (as a rough estimate of IQ), and look for any more detailed IQ       2         1                                                                                                 2      testing - to help clarify the severity of her disorder and the diagnosis      Social Functioning: information from parents and teachers regarding her                    0 C.   social skills - to clarify the severity of her disorder, the diagnosis, and any 1          1      ASD symptoms      Anxiety Symptoms: e.g. re PTSD given the fire in the family home, or re other              0 D.   anxiety disorders like Separation Anxiety, GAD, Phobias, SAD, and any            2         1                                                                                                 2      functional impairment due to anxiety - to help clarify the diagnosis                                                           neurodevelopmental          1         0 E.

Your registrar, Tom, has been to assess Richard, an 83-year-old man who was discharged to a residential care facility from a medical ward two weeks ago, having been diagnosed with a left external capsule infarct. He also has a diagnosis of dementia which was made prior to his stroke. Richard was previously living at home with his wife, Emily, who provided round-the-clock care for him. The residential care facility asked the local General Practitioner (GP) for help as Richard is difficult to manage. They say he constantly tries to get out of bed, is a falls risk and often takes off all his clothes. The GP started Richard on quetiapine and lorazepam with little improvement in these behaviours. The GP and the residential care facility want advice from your mental health service on what other medications may be helpful to manage Richard's behaviour. The nursing co-ordinator insists that Richard is not manageable at the residential care facility as he is constantly getting out of bed at night and needs a 1:1 watch, which is an expense for them. (PTO for model answers)                                                                                                        29 <<<

The main point is not to get fixated about whether the question writers were "right" and you were "wrong" in the model answers, but to practice the marathon of doing a full 2.5 hour paper and mastering the technique required for the different question types. If you disagree with the factual detail of an answer, research the issue and decide for yourself. When marking the MEQs, it's suggested that markers also refer to the 'MEQ Instructions to Examiners' from the Essay paper page of the college website: https://www.ranzcp.org/files/prefellowship/2012- fellowship-program/exam-centre/essay-style/meq-instructions-to-examiners.aspx (login to college site first) NB: In the real exam there's a more complex system to calculate the final marks which we can't replicate in a Mock exam. It's best to aim for well above 50% (60-65% is safer), to allow for that in the actual exam.                                                                                                      1 <<<
MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION 1 (23 marks) You are a junior consultant psychiatrist providing consultation-liaison services in a small District Hospital. Your registrar has been asked to see Mr Green, an 85 year old retired bus driver, regarding his failure to engage with rehabilitation after repair of a right-sided fractured neck of femur. Mr Green was admitted to hospital a week ago following a fall after ingesting over thirty 5mg Diazepam tablets. Mr Green usually lives independently in a retirement village. His only family is a 90 year old brother who lives in another city and suffers from dementia. Mr Green was prescribed the Diazepam to assist with sleep after his wife died six months ago. Question 1.1             (8 marks) Outline (list and justify) the most salient aspects of assessment that you would like the registrar to focus on. Please note: a list with no justification will not receive any marks.                                                                                                         mark                                                                                              worth                                                                                                         (circle)         Assessment of Depressive Symptoms associated with older adults - to clarify diagnosis/risks:         - Sleep disturbance and sleep pattern         - Fatigue,                                                                                        0         - Psychomotor retardation                                                               2          1   A.         - Loss of interest in living                                                                       2         - Hopelessness         - Memory and concentration problems         - Weight and appetite changes         Assessment of symptoms commonly associated with grief - to clarify diagnosis/risks:         - Preoccupation with his wife                                                                     0         - Longing for his wife                                                                 2           1   B.         - Missing his wife                                                                                 2         - Seeking or avoiding reminders of his wife         - Guilt about what he did or did not do for his wife                                                                                                           0   C.

MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION 2 (24 marks) You are a junior consultant psychiatrist working in a community mental health clinic in a regional town. Your patient, Hemi, is a 41 year old unemployed Maori man who is separated from his partner. They have a 7 year old son, whom he sees fortnightly. He currently lives alone in a private rental unit owned by his elderly parents who live nearby. Hemi was admitted to the local public hospital a year ago after he threw himself in front of a bus due to constant derogatory auditory hallucinations. He sustained multiple injuries requiring surgery. Hemi was discharged from hospital on Paliperidone depot which was changed to oral Olanzapine in the community due to a lack of therapeutic response. Six months ago, Hemi was readmitted for three weeks for a Clozapine trial due to ongoing psychotic symptoms. He still experiences auditory hallucinations, although they have significantly reduced since he started Clozapine. Question 2.1            (12 marks) Outline (list and justify) the key factors you would consider while completing a risk assessment for Hemi. Please note: a list with no justification will not receive any marks.                                                                                                    mark                                                                                           worth                                                                                                   (circle)          Historical and static risk factors: (as past and ongoing risks can predict current/future risks)          - Male (higher actuarial risk)                                                              0          - Past high-lethality suicide attempt                                                        1          - Previous violence                                                                          2    A.                                                                                        4          - History of instability in relationships                                                   3          - History of treatment resistant psychotic illness                                          4          - Possible maladaptive personality traits          - Possible cognitive deficits from schizophrenia          Clinical factors: (contribute to current day-to-day risks)                                  0          - Residual psychotic symptoms                                                                1          - Possible impairment of insight and judgement                                      4        2    B.          - Mood & self-esteem changes from stigma and sequelae of long-term psychotic illness        3          - Chronic pain or disability after his suicide attempt                                      4          - Potential for side effects due to clozapine          Psychosociocultural factors: (contribute to his stressors and thus risks)          - Low socioeconomic status                                                                  0          - Lack of a meaningful occupation                                                            1    C.    - Relative social isolation and lack of confiding relationships                     4        2          - Limited access to services and supports                                                   3          - Possible cultural alienation exacerbated by his psychiatric diagnosis                      4          - Cultural beliefs around mental illness and its management          Protective factors: (important to factor mitigating issues into any risk assessment)        0          - Contact with his son is a positive factor                                                  1    D.    - His son may be an impetus to find work (to provide for son and act as a role model) 3      2          - Past treatment adherence (i.e. medication and follow-up)                                   3          - No evidence of past substance use          Did not attempt          Did handwriting affect marking?                                                                Up to a maximum of 12 marks in total                                                                                           TOTAL:          Note to Examiners: Final mark is set at not more than 12.

MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION 3 (28 marks) You are a junior consultant psychiatrist covering the Emergency Department of a metropolitan hospital. Tim is a 42 year old man who is serving a 25 year sentence after being convicted for the murder of his father. He has a diagnosis of mild intellectual disability and while in prison, was diagnosed with schizophrenia seven years ago. Tim is treated with Zuclopenthixol Decanoate 400mg IMI every 2 weeks and Quetiapine 400mg PO nocte. He has remained stable on these medications but due to a weight gain of 15 kgs over recent years, his treating team reduced and ceased the Quetiapine. Approximately three months after the cessation of Quetiapine, the prison guards report that Tim is increasingly paranoid and hostile. He is reassessed by a forensic psychiatrist in prison, who orders Zuclopenthixol Acetate 150 mg as a stat dose. Tim continues to deteriorate, refusing any oral intake and becoming incontinent of urine and faeces, prompting his transfer to the medical wing. The next morning, nursing staff find him with a reduced Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 12, prompting an urgent transfer to the nearby Emergency Department.

The main point is not to get fixated about whether the question writers were "right" and you were "wrong" in the model answers, but to practice the marathon of doing a full 2.5 hour paper and mastering the technique required for the different question types. If you disagree with the factual detail of an answer, research the issue and decide for yourself. When marking the MEQs, it's suggested that markers also refer to the 'MEQ Instructions to Examiners' from the Essay paper page of the college website: https://www.ranzcp.org/files/prefellowship/2012-fellowship-program/exam-centre/essay- style/meg-instructions-to-examiners.aspx (login to college site first) NB: In the real exam there's a more complex system to calculate the final marks which we can't replicate in a Mock exam. It's best to aim for well above 50% (60-65% is safer), to allow for that in the actual exam.                                                                                          1 <<<

Modified Essay Question 2          (23 marks) You are a junior consultant psychiatrist working in the CL team in a busy general hospital. You are called to review a patient in the Emergency Department (ED) admitted under the Toxicology team. The patient, Hugo, is a 19-year-old man studying Veterinary Science. He normally lives with his mother. He has a difficult relationship with his father following his parents' separation when he was aged six. Their separation was acrimonious and was due to his father's excessive alcohol use and violence towards Hugo and his mother. Hugo has a history of self-harm and has made a couple of previous suicide attempts by overdose requiring brief hospitalisation. The first overdose was in the context of his father remarrying when he was aged 16 and the second after an argument with an ex-girlfriend one year ago. Following his first suicide attempt his GP started him on fluoxetine which he took for 3 months before stopping because he didn't feel that it helped. Hugo has a recent history of recreational drug use, mostly MDMA at university parties. He also occasionally binge drinks alcohol. On this occasion, Hugo has been brought to hospital by ambulance following an overdose of promethazine. The ambulance report states that his girlfriend had called emergency services after he sent her a text message with a photograph of several empty pill packets. This was in the context of their relationship ending a few days earlier. In ED, Hugo appears to be drowsy, disorientated and he is picking at the air as though something is there. He is awaiting transfer to the Toxicology ward. However, they have requested your input prior to this. Question 2.1      (8 marks) Describe (list and explain) your approach to the situation and the advice you would provide regarding short term management while Hugo is in hospital.

Modified Essay Question 2 contd. You are a junior consultant psychiatrist working in a busy general hospital. You are called to review a patient in the Emergency Department (ED) admitted under the Toxicology team. The patient, Hugo, is a 19-year-old man studying Veterinary Science. He normally lives with his mother. He has a difficult relationship with his father following his parents' separation when he was aged six. Their separation was acrimonious and was due to his father's excessive alcohol use and violence towards Hugo and his mother. Hugo has a history of self-harm and has made a couple of previous suicide attempts by overdose requiring brief hospitalisation. The first overdose was in the context of his father remarrying when he was aged 16 and the second after an argument with an ex-girlfriend one year ago. Following his first suicide attempt his GP started him on fluoxetine which he took for 3 months before stopping because he didn't feel that it helped. Hugo has a recent history of recreational drug use, mostly MDMA at university parties. He also occasionally binge drinks alcohol. On this occasion, Hugo has been brought to hospital by ambulance following an overdose of promethazine. The ambulance report states that his girlfriend had called emergency services after he sent her a text message with a photograph of several empty pill packets. This was in the context of their relationship ending a few days earlier. In ED, Hugo appears to be drowsy, disorientated and he is picking at the air as though something is there. He is awaiting transfer to the Toxicology ward. However, they have requested your input prior to this. You return to see Hugo 48 hours after admission. He's alert, orientated and Toxicology are requesting his transfer to a mental health unit. He tells you that he felt distressed by the relationship breakup. He is also stressed about disagreements with a supervisor at his clinical placement. He expresses remorse over his suicide attempt and assures you that he would not harm himself again if discharged. He describes impulsive behaviour like reckless driving and binge eating, saying his mood is 'always up and down'. His relationship history is characterised by intense, short-lived relationships that he finds intense and overwhelming. Hugo wants to know why he feels this way. Hugo says he wants to go home rather than continue being admitted. When you call his mother to discuss a discharge plan she expresses concerns about Hugo trying to self-harm again and wants to know why you won't keep him in hospital longer. You arrange a family meeting. Hugo mentions that he has been thinking about 'doing therapy'. Question 2.4        (4 marks) Describe (list and explain) the types of psychotherapy that may be suitable for Hugo. (a list without any explanation will not receive any marks)                                                                                                                             Mark                                                                                                                           (circle)                                                                                                                               0   A     Dialectical behaviour therapy - evidence-based intervention for Borderline PD                                         1                                                                                                                               2                                                                                                                              0  B       Psychodynamic psychotherapy - often used in conjunction with DBT in patients with Borderline PD                      1                                                                                                                               2  C       Cognitive behavioural therapy - a possibility, but less strong evidence for its efficacy in DBT.

 Modified Essay Question 5               (30 marks)  You are working as a junior consultant psychiatrist in a Youth Community Public Mental Health Centre. You have received a referral  letter from a GP (with input from the school counsellor) regarding Marcie, an 18-year-old student who is in year 12 at the local co-ed  high school. Marcie lives with her mother - her father died when she was two and she has no siblings.  The GP's letter states that Marcie started at her current school in year 9 - she was previously in an all-girls school. Marcie was previously  well, engaged in a range of sports and had no academic concerns. However, her grades for the last term have been very poor. Lately,  teachers have raised concerns about her lack of engagement with other students, and reported that she has suffered panic attacks  when asked to speak in front of others.  They say she has been reluctant to come to any sports or swimming events this year. She prefers to wear her loose-fitting sports  uniform to school every day. In addition, Marcie recently cut her hair very short. There has also been a steady decline in her body  weight from 70 kg to 60 kg and to a BMI of 20 from a previous 23.  Marcie appears reluctant to mix with her previous friends. A brief same-sex relationship earlier this year did not go well.  Staff have not witnessed any bullying at school. The school counsellor has raised possible concerns about alcohol use and use of  diuretics but was unsure and said this could just be school gossip. Marcie has recently been referring to herself as "Marc" rather than  Marcie.  Marc/Marcie has asked to see you on their own today.  Question 5.1 (9 marks)  Describe (list and explain) the details of your assessment.

Modified Essay Question 5 contd. You are working as a junior consultant psychiatrist in a Youth Community Public Mental Health Centre. You have received a referral letter from a GP (with input from the school counsellor) regarding Marcie, an 18-year-old student who is in year 12 at the local co-ed high school. Marcie lives with her mother - her father died when she was two and she has no siblings. The GP's letter states that Marcie started at her current school in year 9 - she was previously in an all-girls school. Marcie was previously well, engaged in a range of sports and had no academic concerns. However, her grades for the last term have been near failing. Lately, teachers have raised concerns about her lack of engagement with other students, and reported that she has suffered panic attacks when asked to speak in front of others. They say she has been reluctant to come to any sports or swimming events this year. She prefers to wear her loose-fitting sports uniform to school every day. In addition, Marcie recently cut her hair very short. There has also been a steady decline in body weight from 70 kg to 60 kg and to a BMI of 20 from a previous 23. Marcie appears reluctant to mix with her previous friends. A brief same-sex relationship earlier this year did not go well. Staff have not witnessed any bullying at school. The school counsellor has raised possible concerns about alcohol use and use of diuretics but was unsure and said this could just be school gossip. Marcie has recently been referring to herself as "Marc" rather than Marcie. Marc/Marcie has asked to see you on their own today. After a thorough assessment, including collateral information from Marc's mother (who is concerned and supportive), teachers, the counsellor and GP, and subsequent review, Marc has been diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria and Social Anxiety Disorder. The service you refer Marc to requests a capacity assessment prior to accepting him in their care. Question 5.4       (4 marks) Describe (list and explain) what this process of capacity assessment would involve. (a list without any explanation will not receive any marks)                                                                                                                             Mark                                                                                                                             (circle)        Does Marc understand information relevant to the decision and the effect of the decision - i.e. the risks and        benefits of treatment versus no treatment        (Examples of issues that might be given in explanation:                                                                                                                                 0   A    .   that testosterone therapy could cause permanent changes, e.g. a deeper voice and clitoral hypertrophy                1        .   on the other hand, helping Marc better fit his preferred gender could be very beneficial to his overall wellness        ·   if he has no treatment he could experience more dysphoria, worsening anxiety and potential depression        ·   has he considered trying options for a while that have no permanent effects, e.g. male clothes, breast-binding)        Is Marc able to retain the information as above so as to make the decision (as he can't make a clear decision if         0   B        unable to remember the information)                                                                                      1        Does he have decision-making ability and consistency (this means, is he able to weigh up the necessary                   0   C    information so as to make the decision.

The examiner marking this question will not have access to your answers to the other questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and specifically. Answer this question fully, even if you believe that you have partly covered its content in your answers to other questions.  You are a junior CL consultant working in a small hospital. A 23 year old Indian woman who is an overseas student doing a Masters degree in Economics presents to ED with one month history of epigastric pain, rectal bleeding and frequent postprandial vomiting. She reports 5 kg weight loss in the past month. Prior to this, she was experiencing increased fatigue. She has intermittently used cannabis, the last time around a month ago.  She is clinically dehydrated with a persistent tachycardia, and her bloods demonstrate hypoglycemia and a metabolic acidosis. There is no medical history of note. The ED gives her IV fluids, thiamine, metoclopromide and pantoprazole and she is admitted under general medicine.  The team refers to you with concerns for "major depressive disorder, suicidal ideation and eating disorder". She has been in Australia for 18 months and is living with her boyfriend of 8 months who is also Indian. His parents are now pressuring them to get married, but she is reluctant to make this commitment, as she had a conflict with the boyfriend four weeks ago, after which he blocked her on all social media for three days. She  also has significant financial stressors, having taken out an $85,000 loan for her studies and works to keep up with repayments. She has no other family or friends in Australia.  She contacted the mental health line around four weeks ago, however they referred her back to her GP. The  GP commenced her on venlafaxine at the time. She has not been compliant with this. As a child in India, she had no friends in primary school and changed schools but was then "bullied" by a teacher. She attempted to jump in front of a bus at the age of fifteen. Following this, she had several relationships where her partner was either physically or sexually abusive towards her. At her undergraduate university (in India), she was sexually assaulted by a professor. Her complaint was disregarded by the university. She was subsequently diagnosed with depression by a psychiatrist. Question 1.1 (10 marks) Outline (list & justify) the differential diagnoses you would consider. (Please note: A list with no justification will not receive any marks.)                                                                                       Mark                                                                                    (pls circle)          Major depressive disorder                                                      0             -   Presence of persistent low mood, restricted affect,                     1             -   Anhedonia, suicidal ideation, hopelessness, ruminations of              2                 guilt/failure/shame, sleep disturbance, fatigue             -   Collateral history supports the above          Adjustment disorder with depressed mood                                        0             -   Recent change in mood                                                   1             -   No anhedonia             -   Reactive affect                                                                                                        2 <<<

The examiner marking this question will not have access to your answers to the other questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and specifically. Answer this question fully, even if you believe that you have partly covered its content in your answers to other questions. You are an early career psychiatrist working in a community health centre with the acute care team. You have been asked to see a new patient referred for assessment by his GP. Jack Bower is a 17-year-old male in year 12 of a public high school and living with his parents and two younger siblings aged 15 and 12 in an outer metropolitan area. Jack had a normal developmental history, met all his developmental milestones, and was an average student academically. He typically played soccer on weekends and gamed online with his friends. Over the last few months Jack's family have observed him to be increasingly withdrawn spending more time in his room and he has not been attending soccer practice. There has been a marked decline in his school marks and his teachers have commented about poor attention in class. Upon review with his parents, Jack appeared reasonably well dressed and groomed, however his engagement was limited, and rapport was not easy to establish. His effect appeared flat; however, he denied feeling depressed. When asked about his social withdrawal and poor school performance, Jack just shrugged his shoulders. Jack said that he thought he would do fine in the HSC. You interview Jack alone briefly. He was not much more forthcoming and there was little spontaneity in conversation. He continued to deny feeling depressed and denied thoughts of suicide or self-harm. However, when specifically asked about voice hearing, he conceded that he sometimes heard whispers or people calling his name when there was nobody around. He has this experience daily for about 10 minutes per day. He also said he sometimes see shadowy figures at night. When asked about persecutory ideation, he said that he sometimes feels like he is being watched, but he doesn't know by whom.  There is no history of substance use. There is no family history of mental illness, however Jack's paternal uncle was described as eccentric and reclusive. Question 2.1         (5 marks) Describe (list and explain) your preliminary diagnostic impression and differential diagnoses you would consider. (Please note: A list with no explanation will not receive any marks.)                                                                                                     6 <<<

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Jack meets criteria for the At Risk Mental State for   3                0         Psychosis, ultra-high risk for psychosis, or clinical high risk for psychosis.              1         The pertinent signs for this are attenuated psychotic symptoms he                           2         described such as hearing whispers and seeing shadows, that were not of         sufficient intensity or duration to cross threshold for psychosis. Plus, there              3         is a reported functional decline in multiple domains.        . Jack's eccentric paternal uncle is an additional clue of a possible family         history of schizotypal personality, which adds weight to the diagnosis and         can gain an extra mark.        . Jack does not meet criteria for a full threshold psychosis based on the         information obtained. He also does not meet criteria for schizophrenia.  B    Major depressive disorder (with or without psychosis). While Jack denied a    1               0       depressed mood, his functional decline, social withdrawal, and attenuated                      1       psychotic symptoms make this an important and valid differential.  C     Adjustment disorder. While there is no reported acute stressor in            1               0        the scenario, Jack may be concealing this detail, and this is a                               1        plausible differential.        The upcoming HSC might be a factor in Jack feeling stressed,        overwhelmed, demoralised and/or hopeless leading to loss of        motivation and declining school performance. While he has not        expressed these concerns, it is reasonable to speculate that this        may be underlying the presentation.  D      Prodromal phase of schizophrenia.

The GP commented that Anna seemed more anxious than usual and said she had not been sleeping well, but that she did not seem confused during her appointment. Question 6.1 (8 marks) Describe (list and explain) the most important aspects of assessment in this case. (Please note: A list without any explanation will not receive any marks.)                                                                                           Mark (pls                                                                                             circle)           Obtains history of cognitive symptoms, across multiple cognitive domains (e.g., speech and 1      A    language, visuospatial function, attention, and executive function.)                0           Identifies duration and pattern of change in cognition (e.g., acute, gradual, stepwise).           Assesses for presence of psychiatric symptoms - anxiety, depression, psychosis, etc.           Identifies that cognitive decline may occur secondary to or comorbid with a primary 2      B    psychiatric disorder, or that a cognitive disorder may cause secondary               1          psychiatric/behavioural symptoms that may not reach threshold for a major mental illness 0           (i.e. BPSD)           Assesses functional status - e.g., personal care, continence, household tasks, mobility, 2      C    finances, driving, recreational and social activities.                               1           Must identify at least 3 specific aspects of function to get 2 marks; otherwise, only 1 mark 0           can be given      D    Past psychiatric history - e.g., history of anxiety or depression                    1                                                                                               0      E    Recent and past medical history - to elicit risk factors for cognitive decline (e.g., 1           cardiovascular risk factors, history of stroke, presence of parkinsonism, etc)      0           Medications or substances that may contribute to cognitive decline, including alcohol, other 1      F           illicit substances, benzodiazepines, steroids, high anticholinergic burden          0      G    Social history - nature and quality of support from family/friends, tasks being completed by 1           son, professional supports/services (e.g., through aged care package), loneliness   0           Cognitive testing - 1 mark only if recommends brief screening tool only (e.g., MOCA, 2      H    MMSE, RUDAS), 1 extra mark if recommends more comprehensive tool (e.g., ACE,         1           NUCOG, 3MS, FAB) or neuropsychological assessment                                   0                                         informants                                             1       I   Collateral history from son +/- other                                                                                               0      J    Other investigations - bloods and imaging both required for mark                     1                                                                                               0                                                         Up to a maximum of 8 marks in total                                                                                   TOTAL Note - the maximum mark is 8, even if the total score adds up to more than 8.                                                                                                      28 <<<

During the interview, you notice that Jeff often does not allow Anna to speak for herself and answers for her. He is somewhat pushy and seems to be hurrying you along to make a diagnosis of dementia. You insist that he go to the waiting room while you perform cognitive testing, explaining that this is standard practice in order to reduce the risk of Anna underperforming due to feeling self-conscious in front of her son. Question 6.2 (4 marks) Describe (list and explain) how you would screen for the presence of elder abuse by Jeff. (Please note: A list without any explanation will not receive any marks.)                                                                                            Mark                                                                                            (pls                                                                                           circle)           Approach the topic sensitively and respectfully, explain confidentiality, etc.     1     A                                                                                        0           Ask about physical abuse/aggression.                                               1     B                                                                                        0           Ask about emotional abuse - e.g., use of derogatory language, excessively critical. 1     C                                                                                        0           Ask about financial abuse - e.g., Jeff's access to her finances, pressure to give him 1     D     money or sign over control of accounts, encouraging her to rewrite will, etc       0           Ask about other controlling or neglectful behaviour - e.g., restricting her access to other 1     E     social supports, directing choice of activities/food/clothing, etc.                0           Observe any physical signs that may suggest abuse (e.g., bruising) or neglect.     1     F                                                                                        0                                                       Up to a maximum of 4 marks in total                                                                                  TOTAL Note - the maximum mark is 4, even if the total score adds up to more than 4.                                                                                                       29 <<<

His ex-wife had made 'unfounded accusations' against him, and police implemented an Apprehended Violence Order, which prohibits Jeff from contact with her or his children. Anna explained that Jeff was very upset about being unable to see his children, and that he would do anything to get them back. He is not currently working, and he has had to ask her several times for money to pay his legal bills as he pursues custody of his children. Anna feels she cannot refuse these requests. Anna is also paying for his daily expenses like food, petrol, etc. At one point, when Anna said 'no' because she knew it would leave her short for the electricity bill, she later discovered that he had borrowed her bank card and withdrawn several hundreds of dollars without her knowledge. She is worried about his mental health and asks if you can see him as a patient too.  Question 6.3         (7 marks)  Outline (list and justify) what you would do in response to what Anna has said about Jeff.  (Please note: A list without any justification will not receive any marks.)                                                                                                Mark                                                                                                (pls                                                                                               circle)              Explain your inability to see Jeff as a patient due to the potential for conflict of interest and        A     because he is not an older person that would be eligible for your team.

The examiner marking this question will not have access to your answers to the other questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and specifically. Answer this question fully, even if you believe that you have partly covered its content in your answers to other questions. Modified Essay Question 2: (23 marks) You are junior consultant psychiatrist working in a busy general hospital. You are called to review a patient in the Emergency Department (ED) admitted under the Toxicology team. The patient, Hugo, is a 19-year-old man currently studying Veterinary Science. He normally resides with his mother. He has a history of a difficult relationship with his father following his parents' separation when he was six years old. Their separation was acrimonious and related to his father's excessive alcohol use and violence towards Hugo and his mother. Hugo has a history of self-harm and has made a couple of previous suicide attempts by overdose requiring brief hospitalisation. The first overdose was in the context of his father remarrying when he was 16 years old and the second following an argument with an ex-girlfriend one year ago. Following his first suicide attempt his GP commenced him on fluoxetine which he took for 3 months before stopping because he didn't feel that it helped. Hugo has a recent history of recreational drug use, mostly MDMA at university parties. He also occasionally binge drinks alcohol. On this occasion, Hugo has been brought to hospital by ambulance following an overdose of promethazine. The ambulance report states that his girlfriend had called emergency services after he sent her a text message with a photograph of several empty pill packets. This was in the context of their relationship ending a few days earlier. In ED, Hugo appears to be drowsy, disorientated and he is picking at the air as though something is there.

Modified Essay Question 2 contd.           Candidate Name: You are junior consultant psychiatrist working in a busy general hospital. You are called to review a patient in the Emergency Department (ED) admitted under the Toxicology team. The patient, Hugo, is a 19-year-old man currently studying Veterinary Science. He normally resides with his mother. He has a history of a difficult relationship with his father following his parents' separation when he was six years old. Their separation was acrimonious and related to his father's excessive alcohol use and violence towards Hugo and his mother. Hugo has a history of self-harm and has made a couple of previous suicide attempts via overdose requiring brief hospitalisation. The first overdose was in the context of his father remarrying when he was 16 years old and the second following an argument with an ex-girlfriend one year ago. Following his first suicide attempt his GP commenced him on fluoxetine which he took for 3 months before stopping because he didn't feel that it helped. Hugo has a recent history of recreational drug use, mostly MDMA at university parties. He also occasionally binge drinks alcohol. On this occasion, Hugo has been brought to hospital by ambulance following an overdose of promethazine. The ambulance report states that his girlfriend had called emergency services after he sent her a text message with a photograph of several empty pill packets. This was in the context of their relationship ending a few days earlier. In ED, Hugo appears to be drowsy, disorientated and he is picking at the air as though something is there. He is awaiting transfer to the Toxicology ward. However, they have requested your input prior to this. You return to see Hugo 48 hours after admission. He is alert, orientated and toxicology are requesting his transfer to a mental health unit. He tells you that he felt distressed by the relationship breakup. He is also stressed about differences with a supervisor at his clinical placement. He expresses remorse over his suicidal attempt and assures that he would not harm himself again if discharged. He describes impulsive behaviour like reckless driving, binge eating. His mood as 'always up and down'. His relationship history is characterized by intense and short-lived relationships that are quite preoccupying and overwhelming. Hugo wants to know why he feels this way. Question 2.2 Outline (list and justify) the primary diagnosis and differentials diagnoses you would discuss with Hugo (7 Marks) Please note: a list without any justification will not receive any marks                                                                                  Mark                                                                                 (circle)  A        Borderline personality disorder: affective instability, interpersonal    0           difficulties, , substance use, self-harm, impulsivity                    1                                                                                    2                                                                                    3  B        Depression - pervasive                                                   0                                                                                    1  C        Bipolar affective disorder - type 2                                      0                                                                                    1                                                                                         4 <<<

Modified Question 4 contd.          Candidate Name: You are a generalist junior consultant psychiatrist on duty for the Emergency Department. You have been asked to assess a 14-year-old boy, Jake, brought in by police and ambulance to the ED. The police documentation indicates "domestic dispute with his mother Mary. Has punched holes in the wall and set furniture on fire. According to his mother, he has also been threatening to kill the family cat and has tried to poison it in the past." The ED psychiatry registrar has seen Jake and described him as sullen and sitting with his arms crossed, refusing to speak. His mother was seen in the ED yelling at him "if you keep doing this, you'll never be allowed to come home. I've had enough." Jake eventually agrees to speak and says that he has had enough of his mother who keeps asking him to stop hurting the cat. He points to himself and says "this is Jake, and the mother is always giving Jake shit for not going to school. The mother doesn't care about Jake and is only nice to her feline. The felines don't know the rules and don't care about rules. Jake tried to poison the new feline because it wouldn't listen to Jake, when he told the feline to piss in its litter box. The stupid feline keeps pissing in Jake's room." When asked about drug use, he said that "Jake smokes 'fortified tetrahydrocannabidiol', because the 'diol' is twice the strength and makes Jake's mind chill twice as hard. It's a legal mind medicine in parts of the world." He denied using alcohol or other drugs. Jake's mother says that "Jake has always been a bit odd, and he can't make or keep friends. He's hated the cats forever, is always trying to teach them human rules, and then yells at them when they don't do what he wants. He's refused to see a paediatrician or psychologist because he doesn't think anything is a problem. He can be calm one minute and then loses it whenever I ask him to stop obsessing over rules. He's always referring to himself by his first name only." After your assessment, Jake appears to be calmer, and his mother is open to taking him home. Question 4.4 Outline (list and justify) your provisional diagnosis (2 marks) Please note: a list without any justification will not receive any marks.                                                                                              Mark                                                                                              (circle)           Autism Spectrum Disorder                                                             0   A                                                                                                1                                                                                                0   B           Anxiety/Obsessive Compulsive Disorder                                                 1                                                                                                0   C       Cannabis Use Disorder                                                                                                 1   D       Did handwriting affect marking?                                                                Up to a maximum of 2 marks in total                                                                                     TOTAL Note to Examiner: Final mark is set at not more than 2 (i.e., if they score more than 2, final mark is still 2)                                                                                           7 <<<

The examiner marking this question will not have access to your answers to the other questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and specifically. Answer this question fully, even if you believe that you have partly covered its content in your answers to other questions. Modified Essay Question 5: (30 marks) You are working as a junior consultant psychiatrist in a Youth Community Public Mental Health Centre. You have received a referral letter from a GP (with input from a school counsellor) regarding Mari, an  18-year-old student who is studying in year 12 at the local co-educational high school. The GP letter states that Mari started at her current school in year 9 - she previously was in an all-girls school. Mari was previously well, engaged in a range of sports and had no academic concerns. However, her grades for the last term have been near failing. Lately, her teachers have raised concerns about her lack of engagement with other students, and suffering panic attacks when public speaking. She has been reluctant to come to any sports and swimming events this year. She prefers to wear her loose-fitting school sports uniform daily to school. In addition, she has recently cut her hair very short. There has also been a steady decline in body weight from 70 kg to 60 kg and a BMI of 20 from a previous 23kg/m2. Mari appears reluctant to mix with her previous friends. A short same-sex relationship, earlier this year did not go well. Staff haven't witnessed any bullying at school. The school counsellor had raised possible concerns of alcohol use and use of diuretics but was unsure and said these could just be school gossip. She had recently been referring to herself as "Mar" rather than Mari. She has asked that she comes to see you on her own today. Question 5.1 Describe (list and explain) your assessment of this presentation (9 marks) Please note: a list without any explanation will not receive any marks.                                                                                       Mark                                                                                      (circle)   A    Establish rapport.

    MEQ 2 (30 marks)     Very long stimulus - over one full page !! Essentially a referral from GP to you in community public mental health clinic. 70yo married     male with 2 years of rumination re wife having affair 30 years prior while they were living in Europe for work. He quit his job at the     RSL two years prior following receiving a "paltry" bonus. He was annoyed and still talks about this. He has disrupted sleep. No     thoughts of self harm despite low mood. GP has trialled him on both sertraline and escitalopram (no doses or timeframes given)     with no relief so has now switched him to moclobemide 150mg BD and quetiapine 50mg nocte. Sexual side effects with SSRis have     settled with moclobemide. He is also on sildenafil 100mg prn.     Psychiatrist sees him and gathers collateral from the wife over the phone. She is not concerned about his safety or that of the family.     She reports he started deteriorating two years prior following his resignation from work and the accusations of an affair started     folowing a trip to Europe two years prior. She had recently admitted to him she did have a relationship with another man at that     time, which has made him worse. MMSE performed including other cognitive tests which had a poor result although psychiatrist     states he was very distressed at the time which was likely impacting the results.     Psychiatrist letter back to GP outlines three main differentials, firstly OCD, although noted doesn't act on rumination, second     delusional disorder although thinks may be egosyntonic after wife's admission, third depression but doesn't think it meets criteria.     1.

Candidates had the opportunity to   do well on this question as it was very fair. Many however, only made a cursory or no reference to the history of ECT   which is quite relevant in a tutorial about ECT.    The question of prescribing patterns and auditing provided a good opportunity for reflective practice. Most candidates   were aware of the benefits of peer support, RANZCP guidelines and, processes to explore the problem presented. <<<

 MEQ 2  MEQ 2 vignette covered a key topic in child and adolescent psychiatry and one that should have been included  In the range of experiences had by candidates during their child and adolescent rotation. This question would  easily have identified candidates who had spent time exploring ways of conducting assessments with children  during their child and adolescent rotation. Additionally, this question covered both ethical and professional  issues.  The cohort did not perform well on this MEQ. There was limited ability to consider the broader function of  assessment in terms of generating a biopsychosociocultural and spiritual formulation; emphasis was on  diagnosis out of context. There was a tendency toward paternalistic approaches in dealing with a struggling  junior colleague. Candidates also struggled to adapt knowledge and experience to the specific context of the  question.  A large number of responses suggested that different forms of abuse could be discerned through projective  testing, without qualifying that projective testing should be a part of the broader and more comprehensive  assessment of the child and their experiences. There was a tendency to not actually answer the question, but  rather discuss the importance of play in general, or to focus on the practical aspects of the presentation rather  than the content.  MEQ2.2 presented as particularly problematic with a relatively high proportion of no response provided.  Additionally, the examiner feedback indicated some unintended difficulties. MEQ2.2 was subsequently excluded  from the exam results for all candidates The intended proportional contribution of the MEQ section of the exam  to the Total score was preserved by scaling the MEQ scores to the equivalent of the intended contribution of  140 marks.   MEQ 3   GP referral for assessment of paranoia. long description of a 20 year old patient, parents divorced due to   domestic violence when patient was 15. He is drinking 10 standard drinks with friends at the pub. He likes to   collect action figurines. He doesn't leave the house because he had one episode of his heart racing and he   thought he was going to die. In high school has seen the school psychologist because he was bullied.   1. Possible diagnoses   2. Assessment   3. You diagnose him with panic disorder, agoraphobia and alcohol use disorder. He is reluctant to consider   medication. He has a case manager. Discuss immediate management. MEQ 3 This vignette was based on very realistic clinical scenario with which all candidates should be familiar. There were some very comprehensive answers allowing for candidates to accrue marks easily. However, there were many candidates who did not address the details of the vignette. MEQ 3 question enabled markers to discriminate between candidates demonstrating knowledge and clinical expertise. Psychological concerns or the impact of childhood trauma were inadequately addressed. In general, there were only limited descriptions of the different anxiety diagnoses, and of alcohol related disorders. Few described more than one possible Personality disorder cluster. Social concerns and rurality were recognised as salient aspects of this question. <<<
  MEQ 4   Patient on Clozapine 400mg for 15 years. he complains of feeling tired. wants to stop medications.   1. How would you approach his request   2. You agree to stop Clozapine, how would you manage this   3. A medical student is asking you about how to stop antipsychotics and what kind of symptoms are patients     like to experience when antipsychotics are stopped or changed   MEQ 4   This vignette tested candidates' factual knowledge in changing from clozapine to an alterative   antipsychotic. It also tested the candidates' ability to recognise the need for a collaborative approach with   the patient, family, and case manager in the decision-making process. This MEQ was well answered and   demonstrated core knowledge in everyday practice. There was ample opportunity in the marking guide to   obtain marks.   In general, candidates were not able to identify the need for a collaborative approach in decision making   regarding a change in medication or non-pharmacological approaches in the treatment of chronic   psychosis. Simply listing relevant areas resulted in no marks awarded. MEQ 5 - on website   MEQ 5   19 year old Brooke presents with a paracetamol overdose. History of DSH. She was subject to CSA by   grandfather for a number of years. She overdosed on the day that she had to attend a family gathering.   1. Immediate management plan   2. Risk associated with hospitalization   3. Brooke's psychologist calls your registrar and gives details about the recovered memory therapy they are   providing. The registrar is calling you to discuss. The task is to discuss the ethical issues. <<<
 MEQ 5  Candidates performed well on this MEQ. The vignette was a common and simple presentation in  emergency rooms in a busy hospital that needed to be handled sensitively and appropriately managed. A  large proportion of the cohort did not answer distress reduction strategies well and did not offer temporary  respite for the patient.  Many candidates failed to provide justification for their responses, despite instructions clearly stating that  no marks would be awarded without justification. Guidelines - deliberate self harm General feedback    All of the MEQs addressed clinical scenarios which are encountered in clinical practice in Australia and    New Zealand. Overall, better performances were seen in the curriculum areas of assessment, specific    disorders (anxiety), psychology, philosophy and psychodynamic principles, leadership, governance and    legal frameworks. Statistics on curriculum performance also showed that candidates demonstrated a    relatively poor understanding of ethics, history and philosophy, and specific disorders (trauma and stress    related and dissociative).    Candidates are reminded of the importance of reading the question carefully and including answers    specific to the questions being asked whilst maintaining overall perspective. At junior consultant standard,    answers are required to reflect a capacity to appreciate both broad issues and specific perspectives, and    an understanding of clinical governance. Candidates are encouraged to use supervision opportunities to    discuss consultant perspectives in their daily clinical work and to seek advice and formative feedback on    practice answers.   In all MEQs, there were numerous instances where the candidate had not read the instruction clearly.    Time management and pacing is important in examination preparation to ensure all questions are   answered in the allocated time.   As usual, there were instances where markers had major trouble deciphering candidates' handwriting.   We strongly recommend that candidates are mindful of their handwriting to ensure marks are not missed   because the examiner cannot decipher what had been written. Aug 2019 <<<
 MEQ 1  You are a consultant psychiatrist in a CMHT. Young male Jared (? Age 26). First episode  psychosis 8 years ago- only one prior hospital admission. Recently returned from  interstate. Living with parents. Working at a radio station.  On CTO  Paliperidone depot 150mg  CTO due for expiry in 4 weeks time  1.1     What information (list and justify) would you seek from case manager   1.2    What information (list and justify) would inform your treatment decisions  1.3     Jared wants to know about long-term consequences of Paliperidone   1.4    What is the evidence for the use of Community Treatment Orders MEQ 1 The first MEQ presented a straight forward scenario of a patient's concerns regarding the long term complications/risks of antipsychotic medication. This scenario could be expected as one that the candidates would encounter regularly in their clinical practice. It asked the candidate to deal with a specific patient concern, and what they would do (rather than what they theoretically know). Candidates performed relatively well on this MEQ. Most candidates were able to identify long term complications of the medication use. Most candidates provided a rationale rather than just a listing, and understood the need to evaluate risk and current mental state. While many candidates spoke at length about the risk, they often did not address whether or not there were legal grounds to continue to treat the person under the MHA. Very few considered addressing risk benefit analysis in response to the patient, and only a couple addressed the evidence level available. Consideration of non-pharmacological treatment options often did not occur. <<<
  MEQ 2   You are a junior consultant psychiatrist (? Working in CMHT). You are supervisor to Sarah, a Stage 2 trainee.   2.1 List the roles/duties/purpose of the supervisor in this context as per the RANZCP supervisor principles   Sarah wishes to complete an observed interview to contribute to CALD EPA. Using patient, Iranian, mother of 2   children. Requires an interpreter.   2.2 Outline the general principles when using an interpreter   2.3 Outline effective methods of giving feedback (as a supervisor)   Patient from interview is on an antipsychotic medication (medication name not mentioned). Patient's QTc (corrected)   is 450msec.   2.4 Outline your management to the registrar of the QTc result MEQ 2 MEQ 2 was predominately concerned with governance. It also covered clinical aspects (working with interpreters, ECG findings). Candidates performed least well on this MEQ. The majority of candidates simply listed their responses without a rationale when they were expected to explain and discuss. There was a lack of demonstrated knowledge around multifactorial etiology of prolonged QTc, approach to investigation and management. There was a good understanding of the requirements for protected time and working through assessment requirements. Supervision and feedback is a core skill needed by psychiatrists from their first day of employment, and thus an important aspect of training to be assessed. This is an important area to examine each candidate's knowledge base.   MEQ 3   24 marks   37 electrician living at home with elderly parents features of OCD checking switches and electrical appliances as   worried about having a fire, short term limited engagement with the community team and then disengaged multiple   times in the past, failed engagement and past many treatment trials.   A) Outline (list) factors for poor engagement with MHS   B) Describe psychological interventions/ management plan   C) approach to pharmacological management to OCD <<<
   MEQ 3    This vignette was based on important basic knowledge that all candidates should be familiar with. There was    opportunity for candidates to present information that could be drawn from clinical experience, as well as    textbook knowledge. The majority of candidates performed well.    The candidates demonstrated strengths in their capacity to think through the assessment requirements of    a patient with a chronic anxiety disorder, and in their written communication skills. The format of responses    to the 'justify' and 'explain' prompt was better than in previous examinations. Most candidates in the cohort    knew the overall approach to treatment. There was a good understanding of individual/patient factors, and    overall a good standard of responses.    Despite the question mentioning issues relating to the patient's parents, a number of candidates seemed to    ignore the role of carers in supporting care and were not mindful of their needs. Candidates tended to    communicate very rudimentary descriptions of CBT/ERP, and had haphazard approaches to    pharmacotherapy.    Many candidates rewrote/reiterated sections from the stem which is unnecessary. Many candidates made    a number of assumptions about the patient from the stem, and wrote at length from that standpoint e.g.    assumptions about cultural and socioeconomic background.   MEQ 4   24 marks   22 y.o male, university student Jason. Referred by GP. Has history of depression with prior trials of antidepressants.   Past hospital admissions for suicidal ideation. States he has been unable to complete university course work due to   recent symptoms. Referred with distress, teariness, low mood.   Housemate concerned re "picky" eating behaviours and frequent purging   1) What information (list and justify) do you require in assessing this patient   Discloses to you on interview that he has been triggered by university modules around sexual abuse. Discloses that he   was sexually abused by an older cousin at the age of 12. You are the only person he has disclosed this to.   2) How do you respond (list and explain) to this disclosure   Jason completes two outpatient sessions through a Sexual Assault counselling service. He is doing ?slightly better.   3) Discuss (list and debate) other psychological therapies he may benefit from at this point. Prepare 4 RANZCP <<<
 MEQ 4  This vignette involved the assessment and treatment of a specific disorder. It reflected a commonly  encountered and important clinical scenario. The question was clear in wanting information around  psychological treatment rather than general management.  Most candidates indicated a sensitive approach to the patient's disclosure of past abuse. There was a   good understanding of the range of psychological treatments and what they entailed. However, some   candidates took a very narrow approach and did not justify their answers. Significance of developmental  history, family history and collateral history was often ignored by many candidates, and demonstrated   poor focussed training.  Many responses overlooked the immediate management of the presentation. Much of the discussion   about confidentiality versus disclosure/mandatory reporting was poorly considered. Generally, candidates  made presumptive diagnoses rather than addressing formulation and provisional diagnoses.   MEQ 5   18 marks   You are a junior consultant psychiatrist working with the community Old Age Team. You are referred Mrs Hilton, 69 y.o   married female who lives at home with her husband Mr Hilton. Mr Hilton attends the appointment with his wife, with   her permission.   She has been diagnosed with Early Alzheimer's dementia.   Mr Hilton wishes to manage his wife at home.   1) List and explain key factors in managing dementia in the home   2) List and explain non-pharmacological strategies for managing aggression in the home MEQ 5 Candidates performed best on this MEQ. They showed a good understanding of basic principles associated with carer support in dementia, a very common clinical scenario. Responses were required to have a strong focus on non-medical approach to behavioural issues of dementia. Many candidates failed to provide justification for their responses, despite instructions clearly stating that no marks would be awarded without justification. This MEQ required candidates to demonstrate their ability to prioritise information with reference to the scenario, and to synthesise relevant concepts to provide a clear and coherent response. Some indicators of general time management issues were evident given the brevity of many responses, and some candidates not attempting the question. <<<
  Final comments   Overall, better performances were seen in the curriculum areas of assessment, specific disorders   (psychosis), old age, sociocultural awareness and treatments in psychiatry. Statistics on curriculum   performance also showed that candidates demonstrated a poor understanding of professional   communication and liaison, leadership, governance and legal frameworks.   Candidates are reminded of the importance of reading the question carefully, and including answers   specific to the questions being asked, yet maintaining overall perspective, for example, considering the   context and broader outcomes. At junior consultant standard, answers are required to reflect a capacity to   appreciate both broad issues and specific perspectives, and an understanding of clinical governance.   Candidates are encouraged to use supervision opportunities to discuss consultant perspectives in their   daily clinical work, and to seek advice and formative feedback on practice answers.   In all MEQs, there were numerous instances where the candidate had not read the instruction clearly,   often failing to gain marks for not heeding the instruction, such as 'list and justify'.   Time management and pacing is important in examination preparation to ensure all questions are   answered in the time given.   As usual, there were a few instances where markers had major trouble deciphering candidates'   handwriting. We strongly recommend that candidates be mindful of their handwriting to ensure marks are   not missed because the examiner cannot decipher what has been written. Feb 2019   MEQ1   71y male major depression somatic complaints.

  MEQ 1    The first MEQ featured a vignette involving the assessment and treatment of a specific disorder. It reflected a   commonly encountered clinical scenario.    This was the best performing MEQ in the February exam. In general, candidates identified appropriate risks    associated with the elderly and associated risks of depression.   However, most candidates did not consider that inpatient treatment would have allowed for more frequent observation   and investigations. Very few took note of the history of poor response to treatment so far. Candidates needed to   demonstrate that they were giving instructions to the nurses as doctors addressing the priorities for the patient's care,    and many failed to do so. Instead of identifying the key factors relevant at this point in time for the patient's immediate   care, many gave answers such as 'advise the nursing staff to respect the patient because he was elderly' and    speculated on possible additional issues for an elderly patient such as hearing loss although this had not been in the    scenario. Many did not identify key observations such as monitoring sleep.     MEQ 2     Lady with postnatal depression x2 with two children wants another baby. On venlaxine 225mg. Husband     ambivalent about baby.     - Wants to stop her antidepressant what issues will you discuss (10)     - Husband doesn't want baby and comes to meeting. How would you facilitate discussion (6)     - She's 8 weeks pregnant and she stopped meds (GP confirmed pregnancy). She irritable, low mood,        early morning wakefulness. How would you manage her ? (10)   MEQ 2   Most candidates considered the structure and techniques of the psychiatric interview for the given scenario and   displayed an understanding of the complexities of the situation and how to facilitate guided discussion. Multiple    aspects of clinical care needed to be addressed. Generally candidates either answered history clarification or the   medication discussion well, but not both. Many candidates considered family violence - it is encouraging to see that   awareness of this very important factor is increasing.   A large number of candidates seemingly did not read the question carefully and missed points. Others identified a   range of issues but failed to justify their answers. There was apparently poor knowledge of antidepressant safety in   pregnancy and after birth for the baby and if breast feeding, and poor knowledge of school refusal. Many candidates   appeared to lose sight of the need to take the perspective of a junior consultant psychiatrist in this situation. Many   missed the key issue of providing psycho-education to the couple. Read Maudsley Osce station <<<
MEQ 3 Maria is a 25 year old female with epilepsy (partial and complete seizures) that is treatment resistant. Lives with parents in a country town. Intellectual impairment with IQ of 65. Presents in status epilepticus and goes to ICU. She then accuses nurses of spying on her, talking about her, poisoning her food. - What information would you expect the psychiatry registrar to collect (12) - List and justify diagnostic possibilities (6) - Neurologist says she's continue to have seizures and needs to stay. Nurses state they want her    moved as her behaviours are causing distress to other patients. How would you manage this    situation? (10) MEQ 3 MEQ 3 in its entirety covered the scope of assessment, diagnostic formulation, and management in the setting of consultation-liaison psychiatry. This question required the candidate to delineate the roles of registrar and those of the junior consultant psychiatrist. There was an opportunity to demonstrate a good understanding of the relationship between epilepsy and psychosis - core knowledge at this level. The question pertaining to management provided candidates an opportunity to draw on their clinical experience in training as much as their recall of factual knowledge. The question seemed to identify candidates who had derived enough learning from their training experience. All parts of the question allowed candidates to obtain further marks by demonstrating breadth and depth of understanding. Candidates demonstrated a framework for considering the relationship between epilepsy and psychosis, as well as other relevant medical and social comorbidities. Candidates generally understood the different roles of a consultation-liaison psychiatrist, including the need to enquire into and facilitate the alleviation of ward staff anxieties. Most candidates were aware of the need to involve families and carers, although sometimes this was restricted to more paternalistic applications. Few candidates saw the family as a resource to enrich clinical understanding or collaborate in formulating a therapeutic response to the situation. Many answers suggested that candidates had not read the question or the vignette carefully. A number of candidates had not considered the requirements of a "list and explain" question or, responded as if the patient were still in ICU. Few candidates considered the social context of the patient and her family and the implications of coming from a regional area to a tertiary hospital. <<<
 MEQ 4  Shia something (doesn't mention she's an immigrating). 42, has one child who's 3. Stopped working  as a university tutor and looking after her child. Husband working away a lot. Presenting with  abdominal pain, muscle cramps worse on exertion, poor sleep, low mood.  You are the consultant in community overdose clinic and she took an amitriptyline overdose  - Differentials with justification (10)  - Husband comes and says he does not want to see psychiatrist as community will stigmatise. What     are the causes of stigma in this case (6)  - Does not attend follow up. List and justify the issues around non-engagement what you would     discuss with your supervisor (10) MEQ 4  The scenario was one that practicing psychiatrists would be expected to encounter commonly, attempting to  address mood disturbance in the context of stigma and cross-cultural psychiatry. Almost all candidates recognised that the symptoms might represent a depressive illness. Candidates who answered well demonstrated a grasp of  potential risks to patient and child plus risk of domestic violence. They had a grasp of the need for assertive follow  up and some sense of the dilemma posed by the apparent choice made by patient and her husband. The more  sophisticated candidates could self-reflect on how they may have been in the original assessment, how that might  feel any therapeutic blindness and how to attempt to remedy. Most of the cohort struggled to recognise cultural issues and the possibility of a somatoform disorder. When identified, the justification was poor. Many showed little understanding of the potential tension in the marriage for a couple who might have transitioned from a culture with a very different gender bias. More complex issues such as  clinical perception and service access were also rarely mentioned.   MEQ 5   Toby is 25 year old male who has come to ED late at night requesting a repeat diazepam scripts (with 7   repeats). He has no previous history with services.   - What information do you expect the registrar to have obtained ? (10)   - He becomes aggressive and threatens to self harm saying he's being treated by a junkie. How would      you manage this situation. (7)   - He doesn't attend his outpatient appointment and the registrar is informed that the hospital has      received a complaint from his poor care of ED and want a response from this. How would you advise      your registrar. (7) <<<
  MEQ 5   This MEQ was a good question to test skills around not only clinical management but also managing a difficult   patient, addressing governance and supervising/supporting trainees.   The majority of candidates managed to consider the registrar's state of mind and perceptions about being   complained about. In general the cohort appeared to miss the patient aspects in the scenario and focussed rather   on the complaint and on the registrar. Many candidates were unable to demonstrate appreciation of the key   issues in this scenario such as assessing the competency of a junior registrar on the phone; the need to specifically   mention that one will see the patient with the registrar, and the need to provide debriefing, feedback and   supervision for such an emotionally-charged incident. Candidates who failed to address these issues scored very   low in this question.   This MEQ was not well answered overall. Many candidates failed to provide justification for their responses,   despite instructions clearly stating that no marks would be awarded without justification. A small number of   candidates did not complete the final question, possibly due to time constraints, and this MEQ was the poorest   performed in the February 2019 Essay-style exam paper.  Final comments  Overall, better performances were seen in the curriculum areas of assessment, old age, anxiety and epidemiology.   Statistics on curriculum performance also showed that candidates only poorly demonstrated understanding of   addiction, consultation liaison, leadership, governance and legal frameworks.   Candidates are reminded of the importance of reading the question carefully, and including answers specific to the  questions being asked, yet maintaining overall perspective, for example, considering the context and broader   outcomes. At junior consultant standard, answers are required to reflect a capacity to appreciate both broad issues   and specific perspectives, and an understanding of clinical governance. Candidates are encouraged to use   supervision opportunities to discuss consultant perspectives in their daily clinical work, and to seek advice and  feedback on practice answers.  In all MEQs, there were numerous instances where the candidate had not read the instruction clearly, often failing  to gain marks for not heeding the instruction, such as "list and justify".   Time management and pacing is important in exam preparation to ensure all questions are answered in the time   given.  As usual, there were a few instances where markers had major trouble deciphering candidates' handwriting. We   strongly recommend that candidates be mindful of their handwriting to ensure marks are not missed because the  examiner cannot decipher what has been written. Aug 2018 <<<
MEQ 1 You are a consultant In a community health centre. Your patient is a 39 y.o lady with a history of schizophrenia. Despite good adherence to medication she continues to have distressing auditory hallucinations. She is on 6mg of oral risperidone at night. She complains of EPSE. She requests a change of medication 1. outline your approach On examination she has rigidity and tremor. 2. outline your approach to management You change her to clozapine. After 3 weeks she is on 200mg per day and attends for review. She experiences an episode where she felt hot and cold. Her wcc trop t and ck are normal. Her qtc interval has increased from 450 to 492. Her physical obs are normal. 3. outline your management You keep her on clozapine. Three days later she is admitted to ICU. Her mother who is her next of kin accuses you of negligence 4. outline your response and what you would discuss with the family MEQ 1 The first MEQ featured a vignette involving the assessment and treatment of a specific disorder. It reflected a commonly encountered clinical scenario. This was the best performing MEQ in the August exam. In general, candidates identified appropriate risks associated with exacerbation of psychotic symptoms. However, most candidates did not address capacity or non-medication treatment options. A significant number of candidates also did not mention what they would do with clozapine dosing in the given scenario, nor refer to any outcome measures. Involvement of the patient's general practitioner, care giver, case manager and multidisciplinary meeting to draw up a management plan, was only touched on by a few candidates. MEQ 2 CL psychiatrist. Kelly is a 4 years old girl, with 2 older siblings (both are pre-teens), live with parents. Kelly was admitted to paediatric ward, and she was diagnosed with malignant tumour. Her father, Wayne, became very angry, irritable, and appeared to be hearing voices. Kelly was scared because of dad's behaviour. 1.   Discuss your approach. 2.   List and outline possible cause of Wayne's behaviour. 3.   Describe and debate the ethical issues in this case <<<
MEQ 2 This question was complex with layers of issues needing to be recognized to answer the question appropriately. Most candidates did not grasp the ethical issues around this clinical scenario, and the average score of the cohort for the ethics component of the question was low at 40%.  The responses tended to reflect the specifics of the case poorly. The actions suggested proceeded too quickly to highly intrusive interventions such as involuntary assessment of the father and child safety reporting. Many responses did not deal with the consultation aspects of the setting or consider the broad range of other people who may be able to assist in resolving the dilemma posed by the question.  MEQ 3  You are a community CYMHS consultant. You are asked to see a 6 year old girl. She comes from a violent family  and has been rehomed with a caring foster family. You are asked to see her as she is having troubles sleeping  and says she is hearing voices  1. List and outline your assessment.   2. List (only) the possible causes.  3. List and outline why a diagnosis of a primary psychotic disorder is not likely.  4. What is your management plan.  MEQ 3  MEQ 3 presented a highly relevant scenario which was not too complex. While it was a child and adolescent  question, the need to demonstrate an appreciation of developmental stages, support networks, the role of non-  health organisations, and of the dynamics of diagnosis, are issues relevant to psychiatry across the lifespan.  In general, this was one of the better performing MEQs. Many candidates identified the risks of premature  diagnosis - stigma and inappropriate treatment. Strong candidates were able to cover probabilities of primary  psychosis and differential diagnoses. Most candidates considered multimodal approachs to management and  mentioned seeing the child alone as well as with the foster parents. However, many did not consider  developmental history or medication history as broadly as expected.  A large proportion of the cohort did not comment on the need for shared understanding with all stakeholders and  failed to mention key supports e.g. GP, school, and support agencies. <<<
 MEQ 4   You see a 26 y.o lady at the clinic. She is married and has two young children. She has a history of BPAD and is on   valproate 1500mg and olanzapine 20mg. In her early 20s she had multiple admissions with mania and had had one   episode of psychotic depression. She has been trying to eat healthily but has gained 10kg. she wants to change her   medication   1. Outline your approach to her request. How can you hep her lose weight   2. She wants to start lithium. What will you discuss with her about this.   3. She returns to your clinic explaining that she is now thinking of getting pregnant, outline your advice MEQ 4 The question covered an issue commonly expected to arise in clinical practice. Strategies to address medication related weight gain, and an understanding of the underlying rationale was expected for someone working at a Junior Consultant level. While the candidates demonstrated their knowledge about the use of lithium generally, it was less so in the specific context of pregnancy and breast feeding. This MEQ was not well answered overall. Many candidates failed to provide justification for their responses, despite marking criteria which clearly stated that no marks would be awarded without justification. Additionally, very few candidates provided contextualised responses that would suggest their consideration of the information in the scenario. Many candidates provided generic answers and did not consider issues beyond the pregnancy, such as the wellbeing of the children.  MEQ 5  Emily, a 14 y.o girl who is restricting her dietary intake. She is only eating salads. Her BMI  is 15, and not been eating much at all.  . List and outline what is your initial management plan.  . List the criteria for admission in eating disorder.  . Emily is now admitted. List and outline strategies to prevent refeeding syndrome.  . Emily is well physically and was discharged. Father is a headmaster and frequently not     at home, mother is an interior designer with history of low self-esteem, and issues     about her dieting and body image. Describe your management after discharge. <<<
MEQ 5 MEQ 5 presented a clinical picture of an eating disorder, an important and common psychiatric condition in the  community. Most candidates could demonstrate that they knew the physical consequences of Anorexia Nervosa and the general principles of the guidelines for hospital admission in eating disorders. However, many candidates took an approach that was either superficial or narrowly focussed on the presenting complaint of an eating disorder. There was a lack of consideration of the broader context of the presentation to include developmental, social, legal and family aspects. An often neglected issue was an exploration of treatment preferences. An appreciation of family,  developmental and social factors was lacking in many responses. Balancing patient/family preferences with risk minimisation was sadly absent in many responses. It is appreciated that this question was at the end of an arduous exam and on an area in which possibly few  candidates had had clinical experience, and that this may have been reflected in the often brief and superficial  answers. The relative lack of actual clinical experience was suggested by answers that seemed to reflect some rote learning that was poorly reproduced under pressure. A small number of candidates did not complete the final question due to time restraints and this MEQ was the poorest performed in the August 2018 Essay-style exam paper.                                            Summary ·   Pregnancy, mental health and medication · Managing complaints ·   EDS · Seeing situations broadly (like a consultant) · Child Psychiatry <<<

 MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION                                2  Modified Essay Question 2 (25 marks)  You are phoned by a junior registrar in the early hours of the morning about Damien, aged 32, who is being restrained in the Emergency Department because of aggression and threatening to punch staff. Damien had been brought to the ED by police, having climbed onto the bridge railings of a pedestrian motorway overpass, and having threatened to kill himself by jumping off.  There is a history of poly-substance abuse and intermittent intravenous use of illicit substances. Damien has an established diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder with an extensive criminal history dating back to age 16, including violent offences. Due to Damien's aggression and lack of co-operation the registrar has been unable to interview him. However,  similar presentations in the past have resulted in brief involuntary admissions, with Damien having been released after several days 'without evidence of a mental disorder'. The registrar suggests this presentation is 'bad behaviour' rather than 'mental illness' and is asking your opinion on discharging Damien.  Question 2.1 (7 marks)  Outline what would need to be assessed before Damien could be safely discharged.                                                                                                     mark                                                                                           worth                                                                                                     (circle)              Risk assessment to ensure he's safe for discharge.

Modified Essay Question 2 [Vignette repeated from 2.3] After four days of assessment and treatment Damien is considered ready for discharge. He has stable vital signs, and physical examination (including neurological examination) and bloods are unremarkable. Urine screen was positive for opiates. His threatening behaviour stopped once his anger subsided, although he remains somewhat irritable. He is sleeping well but states he feels 'wired' much of the time.

Modified Essay Question 3 You learn that Ella has been feeling empty and low since starting high school at age 13. She took the overdose when distressed about the break up of a 3 week relationship with a 17 year old boy who she thought she would eventually marry. At the time of the overdose she wished to die, but she also texted him and several friends to "show them what he'd done to me". She has previously taken two other overdoses, both in the context of stressors. She cuts herself about twice-weekly and has previously also burnt herself with matches so as to "feel something". Her GP has prescribed fluoxetine to a maximum dose of 40mg which she reports being compliant with but says doesn't help. Her sleep and appetite are intact. She has supportive parents who have been concerned about her for some time. Her mother reports she was sexually abused by a neighbour between ages 7 - 9 (for which the neighbour has been incarcerated) and that she was bullied at primary school for being slightly overweight and wearing glasses. Question 3.2 (4 marks) Outline (list and justify) the most likely differential diagnoses at this point.                                                                                                       Mark                                                                                            worth                                                                                                      (circle)                                                                                                         0  A.

 MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION 5 Modified Essay Question 5: (23 marks)  You are a junior consultant working in an outpatient assertive engagement service. Stephen is a 46 year old unemployed man with a 15 year history of psychotic illness, including seven inpatient admissions. He normally lives with 2 flatmates in a complex of social housing units. He is treated compulsorily via the Mental Health Act, on a long-term community treatment order. He has a history of assault and of assault with a weapon, which occurred 13 years earlier.  Since his last inpatient admission 3 years ago, Stephen has been under the care of the assertive engagement community mental health team. For much of this time his mental state has been at baseline, which includes a chronic but vague sense of paranoia plus auditory hallucinations characterised as voices that talk to him. The content of his auditory hallucinations has been generally persecutory, occasionally giving him instructions. Generally he has not been overly troubled by these symptoms, and has had no difficulty resisting the hallucinatory instructions.  Over the course of his illness, Stephen has had a number of diagnoses, but most consistently schizophrenia plus an underlying antisocial personality disorder. He also has a past history of cannabis dependence (says he last used this five years earlier) and sporadic polysubstance abuse. Over the previous three years there has been no evidence of mood disorder. Since his last inpatient admission he has been prescribed olanzapine 20mg and risperidone 2mg at night. Over the four weeks before you see Stephen, his female case manager has reported that Stephen has become gradually more paranoid than usual. In addition, Stephen has become harder for his case manager to locate in the previous two weeks and he appears not to have been staying at his unit.  Stephen has also isolated himself from friends. The night before you see Stephen, he was arrested for trespassing on private property after a member of the public reported seeing somebody with a flashlight inside a half-built house at midnight. The police say he's been irritable and uncooperative, and has not given a coherent account of his actions. P.T.O. for Question 5.1                                                                                                 20 <<<

Modified Essay Question 5 After assessing Stephen, you decide to continue to treat him in the community.

 MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION 6 Modified Essay Question 6: (21 marks) You are a junior consultant on-call in the evening and are asked to assess Rebecca, a 24 year old woman who's presented to the Emergency Department (ED) following an overdose of 28 tablets of Paracetamol 500mg and 21 tablets of Clonazepam 0.5mg. Six hours have passed since the overdose. She does not need treatment with N- acetylcysteine and has been "medically cleared for discharge" by the ED. Rebecca is 28 weeks pregnant with her first child. She has a history of intravenous drug use and is followed-up by the local Addictions service. She's prescribed Methadone 60mg daily which is dispensed by her pharmacy each day. On interview, Rebecca describes a four month history of depressive symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. She has not been treated in the past for depression and there is no previous history of deliberate self harm or attempted suicide. Rebecca is unable to give a clear account of the overdose but denies continuing suicidal ideation. She claims to have little memory of taking the overdose. She appears somewhat drowsy, there is some slurring of her speech, and nursing staff report that she is a little unsteady on her feet. Her manner is cooperative and she says she will follow your recommendations. Question 6.1     (13 marks) Discuss (and justify) your initial overnight management plan for Rebecca.                                                                                                        mark        (In general, 1 mark for the issue and 1 for the justification)                       worth                                                                                                       (circle)        Immediate disposition decision - Rebecca should remain in hospital        She hasn't recovered sufficiently from the overdose to be discharged home or for the              0        risk of suicide to be adequately assessed (candidate should note the residual features            1  A                                                                                            3        of intoxication: drowsy, slurred speech, unsteady on feet, impaired memory).                      2        Other reasons to keep her in: she could have taken other substances not seen on tox.              3        screen (will be positive for opiates).

People suffering                                                      from mental health problems were demonised, abused, incarcerated, etc,                                                      often based on superstitious fear and misguided religious beliefs. Modern                                                      funding for mental health programs can also be covered. This is another                                                      "breadth" perspective but it's not a counter-argument to the quote.                                                      A real counter-argument is to say that the quote is all very well, but too  The candidate demonstrates a                        extreme.

Has that extreme expectation led to the  logical argument, and most or all the  arguments are relevant.                             culture of "health blame" we have today, where people are seen as                                                      personally responsible for their mental and physical health: i.e. if only they                                                      had meditated more or been more mindful, or gone to the gym more, they                                                      wouldn't have developed cancer or depression, etc. The Recovery                                                      principles can usefully be raised here, as these emphasise the importance                                                      of well-being and productivity even if the symptoms of a mental disorder                                                      are not fully resolved. So while there may not be perfect mental health, yet                                                      there may be sufficient well-being for good overall health.                                                      ... and there are many more arguments.

Modified Essay Question 3 contd. Abigail proves to be intoxicated with alcohol. She is found a bed in a short-stay unit off the main ED where she is monitored by nursing staff. She falls asleep and wakes six hours later at 4 a.m., presenting as sober. The nurse tells you they have learned Abigail was being cared for by a babysitter and drank wine from an open cask in the kitchen, unbeknownst to the babysitter who eventually called an ambulance after Abigail became intoxicated. The nurse says there was some difficulty locating her parents, but they are now driving in and are expected in about an hour. Abigail is tired and somewhat embarrassed but no longer wants to die and is medically cleared for discharge. Your review does not reveal any history of mental illness including depression or past suicide attempts. Abigail says she has tried alcohol before "a few times".

Stephen is a 22 year old man with a known history of paranoid schizophrenia, who at the time of admission was under the care of an Early Intervention Team. Stephen self-presented the previous night to the Emergency Department in distress, reporting his stepfather wanted to kill him. After one of the ED doctors had taken a blood sample from him, Stephen believed this signalled he would die within two hours. He subsequently fled from the ED department whilst awaiting a psychiatric assessment. One hour later he allegedly assaulted a passer-by, without provocation.

Modified Essay Question 4 contd. On reviewing the notes, you find that Stephen presented with his first psychotic episode two years earlier (age 20). He became suspicious about his stepfather, with whom he lived, and left home due to fears for his safety. He had been using cannabis heavily since age 18. He had no previous history of violence or criminal convictions. He had been studying agriculture at university but left the course 6 months before his first psychotic episode. He responded well to olanzapine 10mg daily which he took for 18 months. Six months ago he lost his job on a farm, recommenced smoking cannabis, was sporadic in his medication adherence and disengaged from the Early Intervention Team (this service was in the process of discharging him at the time of his admission). On assessment, Stephen reported feeling safe from his stepfather as he could not be "got at" in hospital, although he remained fearful of him, especially if he were to be released. He denied any auditory hallucinations. His mother informed you that Stephen had been well until 10 days before admission, since which time he had been spending more time away from home. He had gone missing for two days before the index offence. Stephen accepted oral olanzapine on admission and was nursed in the high care area for three days without incident.

MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION 5 Modified Essay Question 5: (20 marks) Alex is a 9 year old boy referred to the Child and Adolescent outpatient clinic where you work as a consultant psychiatrist. The school have concerns about his poor focus on learning, and say that he appears very tired and is explosive at times in class. The school initially referred him to his General Practitioner (GP) wondering if he was physically ill due to his tiredness, but Alex's GP found no physical abnormality. Screening bloods, including thyroid function and full blood count, were all normal. He presents with his parents Simon and Alison, who separated two years ago in what was apparently a non- acrimonious separation. They have shared custody for Alex and his younger sister Kylie (aged 7). Question 5.1 (7 marks) Outline (list and elaborate) the key areas you would explore in the history of the presenting complaint.                                                                                               mark                                                                                    worth                                                                                              (circle)       General behaviour and Presentation:                                                                                                 0       .

Modified Essay Question 5 contd. Alex's teacher has provided an additional letter. It reports that Alex was becoming very angry at transition points in the classroom when they moved from one task to the next, but this has improved since he has been given a wristwatch and a timetable planner. He now tends only to become very irritable when other children try to interact with him around classroom resources or toys. He is willing to read copiously about reptiles, of which he has an exhaustive knowledge, but will refuse to read any books he feels have a "girly" theme or are otherwise "boring".

MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION 6 Modified Essay Question 6: (25 marks) You are a consultant psychiatrist at a Community Mental Health Team (CMHT). Jeffrey, an indigenous 48 year old man with a long history of paranoid schizophrenia, is under your care at the CMHT, and under a Compulsory Treatment Order. He has been maintained on a traditional antipsychotic depot for several years. He has a history of co-morbid alcohol and cannabis use but rarely presents to local Mental Health Services or to the police. He attends the CMHT regularly to get his depot. He is often homeless but sometimes stays at a cheap boarding house for a while, or else at the homeless shelter. His support network includes the homeless shelter, a local soup kitchen and various other NGO supports such as a local drop-in centre. Jeffrey has been estranged from his family for some time, but his sister, Claire, recently moved back to the area and has requested a meeting with you. Jeffrey has agreed for you to do this to "get her off my back, but I don't want her meddling with my business". Question 6.1 (7 marks) Outline (list and elaborate) the topics you wish to address with Claire.                                                                                              mark                                                                                   worth                                                                                             (circle)      Approach: A.

MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION 5 Modified Essay Question 5: (18 marks) You are a general adult psychiatrist working in a rural community team. You have been asked by a GP to review Kylie, a 28 year old woman who is 18 weeks pregnant. She is reporting low mood, tearfulness, and poor sleep. The GP tells you she was depressed after the birth of her first child (now aged 3) and overdosed on analgesic medication at that time. She is living with her partner who is the father of the two children, and there is some conflict as he was recently charged with a drink-driving offence.

MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION 6 Modified Essay Question 6: (14 marks) You work on a Liaison team and are called to the Emergency Department (ED) to assess Yasmin, a 25 year old Iranian woman brought to hospital from a Women's Refuge, where she had been for 24 hours. She has two children aged 8 and 11, who have remained at the Refuge in the care of the staff. ED staff tell you that she has been badly beaten and has many bruises, and evidence of old fractures to facial bones. They have requested a consult as Yasmin has been largely mute since arrival at ED, often flinching away from staff, especially male staff. At times if left unattended she has gesticulated and muttered to herself and they feel she is confused and disorientated. The Refuge staff member accompanying her was not able to communicate with her while at ED and has had to return to the Refuge. Before leaving she told ED staff that a few hours ago Yasmin's speech and grasp of English seemed reasonable and they had not needed an interpreter. She described Yasmin as initially caring well for her children then becoming more withdrawn and complaining of a headache in the hours before coming to hospital, seeming confused, frightened and at times retching. Refuge staff had been unable to obtain much personal history except that she is married and afraid to return to her husband's household as she says he beats her. On glancing into the cubicle you see Yasmin is huddled on a gurney wearing a hospital gown, with her hands over her eyes. A uniformed male security watch is sitting beside the door to her room. Question 6.1 (6 marks) Discuss the practical and ethical issues involved in using an Iranian interpreter in your assessment of Yasmin.                                                                                               mark                                                                                     worth                                                                                               (circle)                                                                                                 0 A.

The main point is not to get fixated about whether the question writers were "right" and you were "wrong" in the model answers, but to practice the marathon of doing a full 3-hour paper and mastering the technique required for the different question types. If you disagree with the factual detail of an answer, research the issue and decide for yourself. When marking, and for the MEQs in particular, it's suggested that markers also refer to the 'MEQ Instructions to Examiners' from the Essay paper page of the college website: https://www.ranzcp.org/Files/PreFellowship/2012-Fellowship-Program/Exam-Centre/MEQ- Instructions-to-Examiners-1501209.aspx This is a shorter version of the Essay Paper, in line with changes made in 2019. The CEQ is worth 40 marks and is marked out of 40 (final % mark for CEQ is result/40). The MEQs in this paper are worth 126 (final % mark for the MEQs is result/126). To get the overall score, add the final % for CEQ to final % for MEQs, and divide by 2. NB: The CEQ must be passed, to pass this Mock Exam. In the real exam there's a more complex system to calculate the final marks which we can't replicate in a Mock exam. Candidates are advised to aim for well above 50% (60-65% is safer), to allow for that in the actual exam.                                                                                          1 <<<

In medicine, lack of clarity about a terminal illness diagnosis                                                 can cause harm. Marx called religion "the opium of the masses",                                                 meaning belief in an afterlife led to the poor being oppressed by                                                the rich. Cult leaders like Jim Jones have falsely instilled hope of                                                 salvation, causing tragedy. In psychotherapy, collusion with false                                                hope linked to a patient's denial could be harmful. Similarly,                                      5          colluding with a patient's false hope that they could safely cease                                                 crucial psychotropic medication yet stay well could be disastrous.                                              I Are there situations where there is genuinely no hope, i.e. where                                                 a clinician has no hope (either as they lose it or never had it) for                                                 a patient? The problem of 'heartsink' patients could be raised,                                                 where the clinical situation has exhausted a team or a clinician's The candidate demonstrates a                                                 resources.

Similarly, a family having no hope would                                                have a similar negative impact on an individual, and this could                                                potentially be addressed through psychoeducation or family                                                 therapy. 'Existential crises' can arise where a clinician                                                 encounters a person whose situation genuinely appears                                                hopeless and whose decision to attempt suicide initially seems                                                justified. We tend to manage these by providing support and                                                 allowing time to pass (e.g. with a short crisis admission) and by                                                 broadening the people involved in instilling hope by including our                                                 wider teams and the person's friends and family.

You have been asked by your general medical colleagues to urgently see John, a 41 year old Samoan man under their care. John was transferred back 3 days ago from the regional neurosurgical unit and has a peripherally inserted central cannula (PICC) in situ as he requires four weeks of treatment with intravenous antibiotics.

Modified Essay Question 2 contd.  Joanne reports the obsessional thought that she has done something wrong. She relates this to accidentally viewing pornography when on the internet six months earlier. This obsessional thinking leads to her constantly questioning her actions and being unable to make decisions. There is no other compulsive behaviour.

This has deteriorated since she stopped fluoxetine two weeks earlier due to her obsessional anxiety about doing something wrong.

For example, answer question 1.4 fully, even if you believe you have partly covered its content in your answers to questions 1.2 and 1.3. Modified Essay Question 3: (23 marks) You are a junior consultant psychiatrist working in a Community Mental Health Team. Anton is a 42-year-old man of European descent under your care. He has an 18 year history of paranoid schizophrenia and is currently on clozapine. He is treated compulsorily via the Mental Health Act. He lives alone in rental accommodation, receives long-term social services income due to his illness and is supported by his elderly parents who are retired and live locally. He has no other close family Anton attends your clinic complaining that his neighbours have organised with the police to have him monitored and have installed an internet tracking device on the lamppost outside his flat. Anton reports they did this a year ago under the pretence of having fibre internet installed. He has been isolating himself at home and reports that he has no interest in going out and has lost weight because he is not eating. Anton says he has been more worried about the surveillance devices in the last three months and he can no longer sleep because of the fear. He wants zopiclone to help him sleep and a letter to the council to have the lamppost removed, as otherwise he will have to "take matters into my own hands". Question 3.1 (5 marks) List the potential reasons for Anton's presentation at this point.                                                                                              mark                                                                                   worth                                                                                             (circle) A.

   Modified Essay Question 4 contd.    In the referral, the GP explains that Mrs Chin speaks Cantonese and cannot speak or understand English    well, and that an interpreter will be needed for the assessment. The GP says that Mrs Chin's son always    attends and interprets when the GP sees her, as his father's English is also limited.    Question 4.2 (4 marks)    Discuss your approach to communicating with Mrs Chin and her family.                                                                                                       mark                                                                                           worth                                                                                                      (circle)         Pros and cons of using a trained interpreter need discussion:         ·   Advantages - Interpreter will have had proper training in interpreting                      0             technique and is less likely to translate inaccurately or with bias.             2          1    A.         ·   Disadvantages - Mrs Chin and her family may be ashamed to have                              2             another Chinese person knowing their problems, so may refuse.

Mrs Chin may withhold information so as not             to upset her son.         Practicalities of using an interpreter (or Mrs Chin's son) need discussion:         .   Need to discuss the process with the interpreter first, especially if             untrained (her son), and explain what will be covered.         .   Need to face Mrs Chin and husband with the interpreter beside you and                       0             address them, not face and talk to the interpreter.                              2          1    C.         .

Modified Essay Question 4 contd. From the assessment, Mrs Chin's cognitive function is moderately impaired and she has a past medical history indicating vascular risk factors. She does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes, and she has mild hypertension (untreated, to date). Her husband says that her memory has been getting slowly worse for more than two years. Her sadness now appears to be more frustration at being unable to manage usual  activities. She needs to be reminded frequently when doing housework and often loses objects in the house.

You are assisting with cover as the registrar was overloaded with other assessments.  Abigail has presented to ED twice within the past 3 days, each time with overdoses of 10 paracetamol  tablets. Abigail is well known to the ED with multiple past presentations of self harm including lacerating her  wrists, intoxication and overdose. She has now been medically cleared for discharge from ED. The house  officer's notes say that her current presentation was triggered by conflict with her father with whom she  lives, as Abigail says he does not believe her report of childhood sexual abuse by a neighbour who was a  friend of her father. Her father says Abagail has intense mood swings which are difficult to control or  predict.  Question 6.1 (4 marks)  List the most likely differential diagnoses which might account for her presentation at this point,  based on the above information.                                                                                                 mark                                                                                      worth                                                                                                 (circle)                                                                                                  0 A.

Modified Essay Question 6 contd. A comprehensive management plan which actively discourages admission for Abigail due to a past history of prolonged, difficult admissions with regression, angry acting out, and escalating self-harm, is located in Abigail's records. Abigail's regular follow-up is from a community mental health centre and a private psychotherapist. Abigail is now somewhat calmer and has started talking of staying with a friend overnight, as she's still angry with her father. The private psychotherapist then arrives at the ED and talks with you before seeing Abigail.

Will enforcing this jeopardise     2          1       his future treatment and engagement with services?

The Child and Adolescent Mental Health team where you work as a psychiatrist has been treating her for a year, but you have not been responsible for her care until  now. Tanisha is mute, both when seen at the clinic and at school, but her mother says that she talks at  home. She has been diagnosed with selective mutism, and treated with Sertraline by your predecessor, up  to 150mg/day, which she has tolerated well. Your service has attempted to engage with Tanisha to provide  individual and group psychotherapy on several occasions over the last year, but she has refused to attend the appointments. Her mother has attended a psychoeducation group for parents, focussed on anxiety disorders. The onset of Tanisha's anxiety and mutism was reported to be after a fire in the family home from which they were evacuated, when she was 6 years old. Due to there being no significant improvement in her anxiety or mutism you have been asked to discharge Tanisha from the clinic, and so you are reviewing her case record.  Question 5.1 (7 marks)  Outline (list and justify) the key areas you would want to explore in Tanisha's case record.  Please note: a list with no justification will not receive any marks.                                                                                               mark                                                                                    worth                                                                                              (circle)      Developmental History: particularly looking for developmental delays and                   0 A.   repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities - to help clarify her 2          1                                                                                                 2      diagnosis and any ASD symptoms      Educational Performance and IQ: school attendance and her academic                         0 B.   functioning (as a rough estimate of IQ), and look for any more detailed IQ       2         1                                                                                                 2      testing - to help clarify the severity of her disorder and the diagnosis      Social Functioning: information from parents and teachers regarding her                    0 C.   social skills - to clarify the severity of her disorder, the diagnosis, and any 1          1      ASD symptoms      Anxiety Symptoms: e.g. re PTSD given the fire in the family home, or re other              0 D.   anxiety disorders like Separation Anxiety, GAD, Phobias, SAD, and any            2         1                                                                                                 2      functional impairment due to anxiety - to help clarify the diagnosis                                                           neurodevelopmental          1         0 E.

The examiner marking this question will not have access to your answers to the other questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and specifically. Answer this question fully, even if you believe that you have partly covered its content in your answers to other questions. Modified Essay Question 6: (18 marks) You are a consultant psychiatrist at a regional centre that sees patients of all ages. Your registrar, Tom, has been to assess Richard, an 83-year-old man who was discharged to a residential care facility from a medical ward two weeks ago, having been diagnosed with a left external capsule infarct. He also has a diagnosis of dementia which was made prior to his stroke. Richard was previously living at home with his wife, Emily, who provided round-the-clock care for him. The residential care facility asked the local General Practitioner (GP) for help as Richard is difficult to manage. They say he constantly tries to get out of bed, is a falls risk and often takes off all his clothes. The GP started Richard on quetiapine and lorazepam with little improvement in these behaviours. The GP and the residential care facility want advice from your mental health service on what other medications may be helpful to manage Richard's behaviour. The nursing co-ordinator insists that Richard is not manageable at the residential care facility as he is constantly getting out of bed at night and needs a 1:1 watch, which is an expense for them. (PTO for model answers)                                                                                                        29 <<<

MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION 2 (24 marks) You are a junior consultant psychiatrist working in a community mental health clinic in a regional town. Your patient, Hemi, is a 41 year old unemployed Maori man who is separated from his partner. They have a 7 year old son, whom he sees fortnightly. He currently lives alone in a private rental unit owned by his elderly parents who live nearby. Hemi was admitted to the local public hospital a year ago after he threw himself in front of a bus due to constant derogatory auditory hallucinations. He sustained multiple injuries requiring surgery. Hemi was discharged from hospital on Paliperidone depot which was changed to oral Olanzapine in the community due to a lack of therapeutic response. Six months ago, Hemi was readmitted for three weeks for a Clozapine trial due to ongoing psychotic symptoms. He still experiences auditory hallucinations, although they have significantly reduced since he started Clozapine. Question 2.1            (12 marks) Outline (list and justify) the key factors you would consider while completing a risk assessment for Hemi. Please note: a list with no justification will not receive any marks.                                                                                                    mark                                                                                           worth                                                                                                   (circle)          Historical and static risk factors: (as past and ongoing risks can predict current/future risks)          - Male (higher actuarial risk)                                                              0          - Past high-lethality suicide attempt                                                        1          - Previous violence                                                                          2    A.                                                                                        4          - History of instability in relationships                                                   3          - History of treatment resistant psychotic illness                                          4          - Possible maladaptive personality traits          - Possible cognitive deficits from schizophrenia          Clinical factors: (contribute to current day-to-day risks)                                  0          - Residual psychotic symptoms                                                                1          - Possible impairment of insight and judgement                                      4        2    B.          - Mood & self-esteem changes from stigma and sequelae of long-term psychotic illness        3          - Chronic pain or disability after his suicide attempt                                      4          - Potential for side effects due to clozapine          Psychosociocultural factors: (contribute to his stressors and thus risks)          - Low socioeconomic status                                                                  0          - Lack of a meaningful occupation                                                            1    C.    - Relative social isolation and lack of confiding relationships                     4        2          - Limited access to services and supports                                                   3          - Possible cultural alienation exacerbated by his psychiatric diagnosis                      4          - Cultural beliefs around mental illness and its management          Protective factors: (important to factor mitigating issues into any risk assessment)        0          - Contact with his son is a positive factor                                                  1    D.    - His son may be an impetus to find work (to provide for son and act as a role model) 3      2          - Past treatment adherence (i.e. medication and follow-up)                                   3          - No evidence of past substance use          Did not attempt          Did handwriting affect marking?                                                                Up to a maximum of 12 marks in total                                                                                           TOTAL:          Note to Examiners: Final mark is set at not more than 12.

MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION 3 (28 marks) You are a junior consultant psychiatrist covering the Emergency Department of a metropolitan hospital. Tim is a 42 year old man who is serving a 25 year sentence after being convicted for the murder of his father. He has a diagnosis of mild intellectual disability and while in prison, was diagnosed with schizophrenia seven years ago. Tim is treated with Zuclopenthixol Decanoate 400mg IMI every 2 weeks and Quetiapine 400mg PO nocte. He has remained stable on these medications but due to a weight gain of 15 kgs over recent years, his treating team reduced and ceased the Quetiapine. Approximately three months after the cessation of Quetiapine, the prison guards report that Tim is increasingly paranoid and hostile. He is reassessed by a forensic psychiatrist in prison, who orders Zuclopenthixol Acetate 150 mg as a stat dose. Tim continues to deteriorate, refusing any oral intake and becoming incontinent of urine and faeces, prompting his transfer to the medical wing. The next morning, nursing staff find him with a reduced Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 12, prompting an urgent transfer to the nearby Emergency Department. His observations at triage are: Heart rate 105 bpm, Blood pressure 135/85 mm Hg, Temperature 37.9 degrees C, Respiratory rate 15 bpm. You attend the Emergency Department with your registrar to assess Tim. Question 3.1            (9 marks) Outline (list and justify) the key information you wish to gain in your initial assessment of Tim. Please note: a list with no justification will not receive any marks.                                                                                                worth    mark                                                                                                        (circle)        Past Medical History (as he sounds to have an organic condition, possibly NMS):                   0   A.   - Any falls, head injuries, assaults, bleeding, urinary symptoms, GI or respiratory symptoms, etc. 2 1        - Clarify medical history and any other medications he's on that may have predisposed to NMS       2        Collateral History (regarding his past and recent history and to help clarify differentials):        - from the prison: nursing observations from prison, and information from the prison doctor or    0          forensic psychiatrist about his recent symptoms, functioning, medications, Hx of poor oral intake 3 1  B.        - from his family: anything observed on visits about his symptoms, his usual level of functioning 2        - esp. looking for any Hx of mental state changes, behavioural changes, changes to eating, sleep, 3          fluid intake, any agitation or aggression, catatonic symptoms eg.

Modified Essay Question 2          (23 marks) You are a junior consultant psychiatrist working in the CL team in a busy general hospital. You are called to review a patient in the Emergency Department (ED) admitted under the Toxicology team. The patient, Hugo, is a 19-year-old man studying Veterinary Science. He normally lives with his mother. He has a difficult relationship with his father following his parents' separation when he was aged six. Their separation was acrimonious and was due to his father's excessive alcohol use and violence towards Hugo and his mother. Hugo has a history of self-harm and has made a couple of previous suicide attempts by overdose requiring brief hospitalisation. The first overdose was in the context of his father remarrying when he was aged 16 and the second after an argument with an ex-girlfriend one year ago. Following his first suicide attempt his GP started him on fluoxetine which he took for 3 months before stopping because he didn't feel that it helped. Hugo has a recent history of recreational drug use, mostly MDMA at university parties. He also occasionally binge drinks alcohol. On this occasion, Hugo has been brought to hospital by ambulance following an overdose of promethazine. The ambulance report states that his girlfriend had called emergency services after he sent her a text message with a photograph of several empty pill packets. This was in the context of their relationship ending a few days earlier. In ED, Hugo appears to be drowsy, disorientated and he is picking at the air as though something is there. He is awaiting transfer to the Toxicology ward. However, they have requested your input prior to this. Question 2.1      (8 marks) Describe (list and explain) your approach to the situation and the advice you would provide regarding short term management while Hugo is in hospital.

Modified Essay Question 2 contd. You are a junior consultant psychiatrist working in a busy general hospital. You are called to review a patient in the Emergency Department (ED) admitted under the Toxicology team. The patient, Hugo, is a 19-year-old man studying Veterinary Science. He normally lives with his mother. He has a difficult relationship with his father following his parents' separation when he was aged six. Their separation was acrimonious and was due to his father's excessive alcohol use and violence towards Hugo and his mother. Hugo has a history of self-harm and has made a couple of previous suicide attempts by overdose requiring brief hospitalisation. The first overdose was in the context of his father remarrying when he was aged 16 and the second after an argument with an ex-girlfriend one year ago. Following his first suicide attempt his GP started him on fluoxetine which he took for 3 months before stopping because he didn't feel that it helped. Hugo has a recent history of recreational drug use, mostly MDMA at university parties. He also occasionally binge drinks alcohol. On this occasion, Hugo has been brought to hospital by ambulance following an overdose of promethazine. The ambulance report states that his girlfriend had called emergency services after he sent her a text message with a photograph of several empty pill packets. This was in the context of their relationship ending a few days earlier. In ED, Hugo appears to be drowsy, disorientated and he is picking at the air as though something is there. He is awaiting transfer to the Toxicology ward. However, they have requested your input prior to this. You return to see Hugo 48 hours after admission. He's alert, orientated and Toxicology are requesting his transfer to a mental health unit. He tells you that he felt distressed by the relationship breakup. He is also stressed about disagreements with a supervisor at his clinical placement. He expresses remorse over his suicide attempt and assures you that he would not harm himself again if discharged. He describes impulsive behaviour like reckless driving and binge eating, saying his mood is 'always up and down'. His relationship history is characterised by intense, short-lived relationships that he finds intense and overwhelming. Hugo wants to know why he feels this way. Hugo says he wants to go home rather than continue being admitted. When you call his mother to discuss a discharge plan she expresses concerns about Hugo trying to self-harm again and wants to know why you won't keep him in hospital longer. You arrange a family meeting. Hugo mentions that he has been thinking about 'doing therapy'. Question 2.4        (4 marks) Describe (list and explain) the types of psychotherapy that may be suitable for Hugo. (a list without any explanation will not receive any marks)                                                                                                                             Mark                                                                                                                           (circle)                                                                                                                               0   A     Dialectical behaviour therapy - evidence-based intervention for Borderline PD                                         1                                                                                                                               2                                                                                                                              0  B       Psychodynamic psychotherapy - often used in conjunction with DBT in patients with Borderline PD                      1                                                                                                                               2  C       Cognitive behavioural therapy - a possibility, but less strong evidence for its efficacy in DBT.

 Modified Essay Question 5               (30 marks)  You are working as a junior consultant psychiatrist in a Youth Community Public Mental Health Centre. You have received a referral  letter from a GP (with input from the school counsellor) regarding Marcie, an 18-year-old student who is in year 12 at the local co-ed  high school. Marcie lives with her mother - her father died when she was two and she has no siblings.  The GP's letter states that Marcie started at her current school in year 9 - she was previously in an all-girls school. Marcie was previously  well, engaged in a range of sports and had no academic concerns. However, her grades for the last term have been very poor. Lately,  teachers have raised concerns about her lack of engagement with other students, and reported that she has suffered panic attacks  when asked to speak in front of others.  They say she has been reluctant to come to any sports or swimming events this year. She prefers to wear her loose-fitting sports  uniform to school every day. In addition, Marcie recently cut her hair very short. There has also been a steady decline in her body  weight from 70 kg to 60 kg and to a BMI of 20 from a previous 23.  Marcie appears reluctant to mix with her previous friends. A brief same-sex relationship earlier this year did not go well.  Staff have not witnessed any bullying at school. The school counsellor has raised possible concerns about alcohol use and use of  diuretics but was unsure and said this could just be school gossip. Marcie has recently been referring to herself as "Marc" rather than  Marcie.  Marc/Marcie has asked to see you on their own today.  Question 5.1 (9 marks)  Describe (list and explain) the details of your assessment.

Modified Essay Question 5 contd. You are working as a junior consultant psychiatrist in a Youth Community Public Mental Health Centre. You have received a referral letter from a GP (with input from the school counsellor) regarding Marcie, an 18-year-old student who is in year 12 at the local co-ed high school. Marcie lives with her mother - her father died when she was two and she has no siblings. The GP's letter states that Marcie started at her current school in year 9 - she was previously in an all-girls school. Marcie was previously well, engaged in a range of sports and had no academic concerns. However, her grades for the last term have been near failing. Lately, teachers have raised concerns about her lack of engagement with other students, and reported that she has suffered panic attacks when asked to speak in front of others. They say she has been reluctant to come to any sports or swimming events this year. She prefers to wear her loose-fitting sports uniform to school every day. In addition, Marcie recently cut her hair very short. There has also been a steady decline in body weight from 70 kg to 60 kg and to a BMI of 20 from a previous 23. Marcie appears reluctant to mix with her previous friends. A brief same-sex relationship earlier this year did not go well. Staff have not witnessed any bullying at school. The school counsellor has raised possible concerns about alcohol use and use of diuretics but was unsure and said this could just be school gossip. Marcie has recently been referring to herself as "Marc" rather than Marcie. Marc/Marcie has asked to see you on their own today. After a thorough assessment, including collateral information from Marc's mother (who is concerned and supportive), teachers, the counsellor and GP, and subsequent review, Marc has been diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria and Social Anxiety Disorder. The service you refer Marc to requests a capacity assessment prior to accepting him in their care. Question 5.4       (4 marks) Describe (list and explain) what this process of capacity assessment would involve. (a list without any explanation will not receive any marks)                                                                                                                             Mark                                                                                                                             (circle)        Does Marc understand information relevant to the decision and the effect of the decision - i.e. the risks and        benefits of treatment versus no treatment        (Examples of issues that might be given in explanation:                                                                                                                                 0   A    .   that testosterone therapy could cause permanent changes, e.g. a deeper voice and clitoral hypertrophy                1        .   on the other hand, helping Marc better fit his preferred gender could be very beneficial to his overall wellness        ·   if he has no treatment he could experience more dysphoria, worsening anxiety and potential depression        ·   has he considered trying options for a while that have no permanent effects, e.g. male clothes, breast-binding)        Is Marc able to retain the information as above so as to make the decision (as he can't make a clear decision if         0   B        unable to remember the information)                                                                                      1        Does he have decision-making ability and consistency (this means, is he able to weigh up the necessary                   0   C    information so as to make the decision.

The examiner marking this question will not have access to your answers to the other questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and specifically. Answer this question fully, even if you believe that you have partly covered its content in your answers to other questions.  You are a junior CL consultant working in a small hospital. A 23 year old Indian woman who is an overseas student doing a Masters degree in Economics presents to ED with one month history of epigastric pain, rectal bleeding and frequent postprandial vomiting. She reports 5 kg weight loss in the past month. Prior to this, she was experiencing increased fatigue. She has intermittently used cannabis, the last time around a month ago.  She is clinically dehydrated with a persistent tachycardia, and her bloods demonstrate hypoglycemia and a metabolic acidosis. There is no medical history of note. The ED gives her IV fluids, thiamine, metoclopromide and pantoprazole and she is admitted under general medicine.  The team refers to you with concerns for "major depressive disorder, suicidal ideation and eating disorder". She has been in Australia for 18 months and is living with her boyfriend of 8 months who is also Indian. His parents are now pressuring them to get married, but she is reluctant to make this commitment, as she had a conflict with the boyfriend four weeks ago, after which he blocked her on all social media for three days. She  also has significant financial stressors, having taken out an $85,000 loan for her studies and works to keep up with repayments. She has no other family or friends in Australia.  She contacted the mental health line around four weeks ago, however they referred her back to her GP. The  GP commenced her on venlafaxine at the time. She has not been compliant with this. As a child in India, she had no friends in primary school and changed schools but was then "bullied" by a teacher. She attempted to jump in front of a bus at the age of fifteen. Following this, she had several relationships where her partner was either physically or sexually abusive towards her. At her undergraduate university (in India), she was sexually assaulted by a professor. Her complaint was disregarded by the university. She was subsequently diagnosed with depression by a psychiatrist. Question 1.1 (10 marks) Outline (list & justify) the differential diagnoses you would consider. (Please note: A list with no justification will not receive any marks.)                                                                                       Mark                                                                                    (pls circle)          Major depressive disorder                                                      0             -   Presence of persistent low mood, restricted affect,                     1             -   Anhedonia, suicidal ideation, hopelessness, ruminations of              2                 guilt/failure/shame, sleep disturbance, fatigue             -   Collateral history supports the above          Adjustment disorder with depressed mood                                        0             -   Recent change in mood                                                   1             -   No anhedonia             -   Reactive affect                                                                                                        2 <<<

The examiner marking this question will not have access to your answers to the other questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and specifically. Answer this question fully, even if you believe that you have partly covered its content in your answers to other questions. You are an early career psychiatrist working in a community health centre with the acute care team. You have been asked to see a new patient referred for assessment by his GP. Jack Bower is a 17-year-old male in year 12 of a public high school and living with his parents and two younger siblings aged 15 and 12 in an outer metropolitan area. Jack had a normal developmental history, met all his developmental milestones, and was an average student academically. He typically played soccer on weekends and gamed online with his friends. Over the last few months Jack's family have observed him to be increasingly withdrawn spending more time in his room and he has not been attending soccer practice. There has been a marked decline in his school marks and his teachers have commented about poor attention in class. Upon review with his parents, Jack appeared reasonably well dressed and groomed, however his engagement was limited, and rapport was not easy to establish. His effect appeared flat; however, he denied feeling depressed. When asked about his social withdrawal and poor school performance, Jack just shrugged his shoulders. Jack said that he thought he would do fine in the HSC. You interview Jack alone briefly. He was not much more forthcoming and there was little spontaneity in conversation. He continued to deny feeling depressed and denied thoughts of suicide or self-harm. However, when specifically asked about voice hearing, he conceded that he sometimes heard whispers or people calling his name when there was nobody around. He has this experience daily for about 10 minutes per day. He also said he sometimes see shadowy figures at night. When asked about persecutory ideation, he said that he sometimes feels like he is being watched, but he doesn't know by whom.  There is no history of substance use. There is no family history of mental illness, however Jack's paternal uncle was described as eccentric and reclusive. Question 2.1         (5 marks) Describe (list and explain) your preliminary diagnostic impression and differential diagnoses you would consider. (Please note: A list with no explanation will not receive any marks.)                                                                                                     6 <<<

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Jack meets criteria for the At Risk Mental State for   3                0         Psychosis, ultra-high risk for psychosis, or clinical high risk for psychosis.              1         The pertinent signs for this are attenuated psychotic symptoms he                           2         described such as hearing whispers and seeing shadows, that were not of         sufficient intensity or duration to cross threshold for psychosis. Plus, there              3         is a reported functional decline in multiple domains.        . Jack's eccentric paternal uncle is an additional clue of a possible family         history of schizotypal personality, which adds weight to the diagnosis and         can gain an extra mark.        . Jack does not meet criteria for a full threshold psychosis based on the         information obtained. He also does not meet criteria for schizophrenia.  B    Major depressive disorder (with or without psychosis). While Jack denied a    1               0       depressed mood, his functional decline, social withdrawal, and attenuated                      1       psychotic symptoms make this an important and valid differential.  C     Adjustment disorder. While there is no reported acute stressor in            1               0        the scenario, Jack may be concealing this detail, and this is a                               1        plausible differential.        The upcoming HSC might be a factor in Jack feeling stressed,        overwhelmed, demoralised and/or hopeless leading to loss of        motivation and declining school performance. While he has not        expressed these concerns, it is reasonable to speculate that this        may be underlying the presentation.  D      Prodromal phase of schizophrenia.

The GP commented that Anna seemed more anxious than usual and said she had not been sleeping well, but that she did not seem confused during her appointment. Question 6.1 (8 marks) Describe (list and explain) the most important aspects of assessment in this case. (Please note: A list without any explanation will not receive any marks.)                                                                                           Mark (pls                                                                                             circle)           Obtains history of cognitive symptoms, across multiple cognitive domains (e.g., speech and 1      A    language, visuospatial function, attention, and executive function.)                0           Identifies duration and pattern of change in cognition (e.g., acute, gradual, stepwise).           Assesses for presence of psychiatric symptoms - anxiety, depression, psychosis, etc.           Identifies that cognitive decline may occur secondary to or comorbid with a primary 2      B    psychiatric disorder, or that a cognitive disorder may cause secondary               1          psychiatric/behavioural symptoms that may not reach threshold for a major mental illness 0           (i.e. BPSD)           Assesses functional status - e.g., personal care, continence, household tasks, mobility, 2      C    finances, driving, recreational and social activities.                               1           Must identify at least 3 specific aspects of function to get 2 marks; otherwise, only 1 mark 0           can be given      D    Past psychiatric history - e.g., history of anxiety or depression                    1                                                                                               0      E    Recent and past medical history - to elicit risk factors for cognitive decline (e.g., 1           cardiovascular risk factors, history of stroke, presence of parkinsonism, etc)      0           Medications or substances that may contribute to cognitive decline, including alcohol, other 1      F           illicit substances, benzodiazepines, steroids, high anticholinergic burden          0      G    Social history - nature and quality of support from family/friends, tasks being completed by 1           son, professional supports/services (e.g., through aged care package), loneliness   0           Cognitive testing - 1 mark only if recommends brief screening tool only (e.g., MOCA, 2      H    MMSE, RUDAS), 1 extra mark if recommends more comprehensive tool (e.g., ACE,         1           NUCOG, 3MS, FAB) or neuropsychological assessment                                   0                                         informants                                             1       I   Collateral history from son +/- other                                                                                               0      J    Other investigations - bloods and imaging both required for mark                     1                                                                                               0                                                         Up to a maximum of 8 marks in total                                                                                   TOTAL Note - the maximum mark is 8, even if the total score adds up to more than 8.                                                                                                      28 <<<

During the interview, you notice that Jeff often does not allow Anna to speak for herself and answers for her. He is somewhat pushy and seems to be hurrying you along to make a diagnosis of dementia. You insist that he go to the waiting room while you perform cognitive testing, explaining that this is standard practice in order to reduce the risk of Anna underperforming due to feeling self-conscious in front of her son. Question 6.2 (4 marks) Describe (list and explain) how you would screen for the presence of elder abuse by Jeff. (Please note: A list without any explanation will not receive any marks.)                                                                                            Mark                                                                                            (pls                                                                                           circle)           Approach the topic sensitively and respectfully, explain confidentiality, etc.     1     A                                                                                        0           Ask about physical abuse/aggression.                                               1     B                                                                                        0           Ask about emotional abuse - e.g., use of derogatory language, excessively critical. 1     C                                                                                        0           Ask about financial abuse - e.g., Jeff's access to her finances, pressure to give him 1     D     money or sign over control of accounts, encouraging her to rewrite will, etc       0           Ask about other controlling or neglectful behaviour - e.g., restricting her access to other 1     E     social supports, directing choice of activities/food/clothing, etc.                0           Observe any physical signs that may suggest abuse (e.g., bruising) or neglect.     1     F                                                                                        0                                                       Up to a maximum of 4 marks in total                                                                                  TOTAL Note - the maximum mark is 4, even if the total score adds up to more than 4.                                                                                                       29 <<<

His ex-wife had made 'unfounded accusations' against him, and police implemented an Apprehended Violence Order, which prohibits Jeff from contact with her or his children. Anna explained that Jeff was very upset about being unable to see his children, and that he would do anything to get them back. He is not currently working, and he has had to ask her several times for money to pay his legal bills as he pursues custody of his children. Anna feels she cannot refuse these requests. Anna is also paying for his daily expenses like food, petrol, etc. At one point, when Anna said 'no' because she knew it would leave her short for the electricity bill, she later discovered that he had borrowed her bank card and withdrawn several hundreds of dollars without her knowledge. She is worried about his mental health and asks if you can see him as a patient too.  Question 6.3         (7 marks)  Outline (list and justify) what you would do in response to what Anna has said about Jeff.  (Please note: A list without any justification will not receive any marks.)                                                                                                Mark                                                                                                (pls                                                                                               circle)              Explain your inability to see Jeff as a patient due to the potential for conflict of interest and        A     because he is not an older person that would be eligible for your team.

The examiner marking this question will not have access to your answers to the other questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and specifically. Answer this question fully, even if you believe that you have partly covered its content in your answers to other questions. Modified Essay Question 2: (23 marks) You are junior consultant psychiatrist working in a busy general hospital. You are called to review a patient in the Emergency Department (ED) admitted under the Toxicology team. The patient, Hugo, is a 19-year-old man currently studying Veterinary Science. He normally resides with his mother. He has a history of a difficult relationship with his father following his parents' separation when he was six years old. Their separation was acrimonious and related to his father's excessive alcohol use and violence towards Hugo and his mother. Hugo has a history of self-harm and has made a couple of previous suicide attempts by overdose requiring brief hospitalisation. The first overdose was in the context of his father remarrying when he was 16 years old and the second following an argument with an ex-girlfriend one year ago. Following his first suicide attempt his GP commenced him on fluoxetine which he took for 3 months before stopping because he didn't feel that it helped. Hugo has a recent history of recreational drug use, mostly MDMA at university parties. He also occasionally binge drinks alcohol. On this occasion, Hugo has been brought to hospital by ambulance following an overdose of promethazine. The ambulance report states that his girlfriend had called emergency services after he sent her a text message with a photograph of several empty pill packets. This was in the context of their relationship ending a few days earlier. In ED, Hugo appears to be drowsy, disorientated and he is picking at the air as though something is there.

Modified Essay Question 2 contd.           Candidate Name: You are junior consultant psychiatrist working in a busy general hospital. You are called to review a patient in the Emergency Department (ED) admitted under the Toxicology team. The patient, Hugo, is a 19-year-old man currently studying Veterinary Science. He normally resides with his mother. He has a history of a difficult relationship with his father following his parents' separation when he was six years old. Their separation was acrimonious and related to his father's excessive alcohol use and violence towards Hugo and his mother. Hugo has a history of self-harm and has made a couple of previous suicide attempts via overdose requiring brief hospitalisation. The first overdose was in the context of his father remarrying when he was 16 years old and the second following an argument with an ex-girlfriend one year ago. Following his first suicide attempt his GP commenced him on fluoxetine which he took for 3 months before stopping because he didn't feel that it helped. Hugo has a recent history of recreational drug use, mostly MDMA at university parties. He also occasionally binge drinks alcohol. On this occasion, Hugo has been brought to hospital by ambulance following an overdose of promethazine. The ambulance report states that his girlfriend had called emergency services after he sent her a text message with a photograph of several empty pill packets. This was in the context of their relationship ending a few days earlier. In ED, Hugo appears to be drowsy, disorientated and he is picking at the air as though something is there. He is awaiting transfer to the Toxicology ward. However, they have requested your input prior to this. You return to see Hugo 48 hours after admission. He is alert, orientated and toxicology are requesting his transfer to a mental health unit. He tells you that he felt distressed by the relationship breakup. He is also stressed about differences with a supervisor at his clinical placement. He expresses remorse over his suicidal attempt and assures that he would not harm himself again if discharged. He describes impulsive behaviour like reckless driving, binge eating. His mood as 'always up and down'. His relationship history is characterized by intense and short-lived relationships that are quite preoccupying and overwhelming. Hugo wants to know why he feels this way. Question 2.2 Outline (list and justify) the primary diagnosis and differentials diagnoses you would discuss with Hugo (7 Marks) Please note: a list without any justification will not receive any marks                                                                                  Mark                                                                                 (circle)  A        Borderline personality disorder: affective instability, interpersonal    0           difficulties, , substance use, self-harm, impulsivity                    1                                                                                    2                                                                                    3  B        Depression - pervasive                                                   0                                                                                    1  C        Bipolar affective disorder - type 2                                      0                                                                                    1                                                                                         4 <<<

Modified Question 4 contd.          Candidate Name: You are a generalist junior consultant psychiatrist on duty for the Emergency Department. You have been asked to assess a 14-year-old boy, Jake, brought in by police and ambulance to the ED. The police documentation indicates "domestic dispute with his mother Mary. Has punched holes in the wall and set furniture on fire. According to his mother, he has also been threatening to kill the family cat and has tried to poison it in the past." The ED psychiatry registrar has seen Jake and described him as sullen and sitting with his arms crossed, refusing to speak. His mother was seen in the ED yelling at him "if you keep doing this, you'll never be allowed to come home. I've had enough." Jake eventually agrees to speak and says that he has had enough of his mother who keeps asking him to stop hurting the cat. He points to himself and says "this is Jake, and the mother is always giving Jake shit for not going to school. The mother doesn't care about Jake and is only nice to her feline. The felines don't know the rules and don't care about rules. Jake tried to poison the new feline because it wouldn't listen to Jake, when he told the feline to piss in its litter box. The stupid feline keeps pissing in Jake's room." When asked about drug use, he said that "Jake smokes 'fortified tetrahydrocannabidiol', because the 'diol' is twice the strength and makes Jake's mind chill twice as hard. It's a legal mind medicine in parts of the world." He denied using alcohol or other drugs. Jake's mother says that "Jake has always been a bit odd, and he can't make or keep friends. He's hated the cats forever, is always trying to teach them human rules, and then yells at them when they don't do what he wants. He's refused to see a paediatrician or psychologist because he doesn't think anything is a problem. He can be calm one minute and then loses it whenever I ask him to stop obsessing over rules. He's always referring to himself by his first name only." After your assessment, Jake appears to be calmer, and his mother is open to taking him home. Question 4.4 Outline (list and justify) your provisional diagnosis (2 marks) Please note: a list without any justification will not receive any marks.                                                                                              Mark                                                                                              (circle)           Autism Spectrum Disorder                                                             0   A                                                                                                1                                                                                                0   B           Anxiety/Obsessive Compulsive Disorder                                                 1                                                                                                0   C       Cannabis Use Disorder                                                                                                 1   D       Did handwriting affect marking?                                                                Up to a maximum of 2 marks in total                                                                                     TOTAL Note to Examiner: Final mark is set at not more than 2 (i.e., if they score more than 2, final mark is still 2)                                                                                           7 <<<

The examiner marking this question will not have access to your answers to the other questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and specifically. Answer this question fully, even if you believe that you have partly covered its content in your answers to other questions. Modified Essay Question 5: (30 marks) You are working as a junior consultant psychiatrist in a Youth Community Public Mental Health Centre. You have received a referral letter from a GP (with input from a school counsellor) regarding Mari, an  18-year-old student who is studying in year 12 at the local co-educational high school. The GP letter states that Mari started at her current school in year 9 - she previously was in an all-girls school. Mari was previously well, engaged in a range of sports and had no academic concerns. However, her grades for the last term have been near failing. Lately, her teachers have raised concerns about her lack of engagement with other students, and suffering panic attacks when public speaking. She has been reluctant to come to any sports and swimming events this year. She prefers to wear her loose-fitting school sports uniform daily to school. In addition, she has recently cut her hair very short. There has also been a steady decline in body weight from 70 kg to 60 kg and a BMI of 20 from a previous 23kg/m2. Mari appears reluctant to mix with her previous friends. A short same-sex relationship, earlier this year did not go well. Staff haven't witnessed any bullying at school. The school counsellor had raised possible concerns of alcohol use and use of diuretics but was unsure and said these could just be school gossip. She had recently been referring to herself as "Mar" rather than Mari. She has asked that she comes to see you on her own today. Question 5.1 Describe (list and explain) your assessment of this presentation (9 marks) Please note: a list without any explanation will not receive any marks.                                                                                       Mark                                                                                      (circle)   A    Establish rapport.

    MEQ 2 (30 marks)     Very long stimulus - over one full page !! Essentially a referral from GP to you in community public mental health clinic. 70yo married     male with 2 years of rumination re wife having affair 30 years prior while they were living in Europe for work. He quit his job at the     RSL two years prior following receiving a "paltry" bonus. He was annoyed and still talks about this. He has disrupted sleep. No     thoughts of self harm despite low mood. GP has trialled him on both sertraline and escitalopram (no doses or timeframes given)     with no relief so has now switched him to moclobemide 150mg BD and quetiapine 50mg nocte. Sexual side effects with SSRis have     settled with moclobemide. He is also on sildenafil 100mg prn.     Psychiatrist sees him and gathers collateral from the wife over the phone. She is not concerned about his safety or that of the family.     She reports he started deteriorating two years prior following his resignation from work and the accusations of an affair started     folowing a trip to Europe two years prior. She had recently admitted to him she did have a relationship with another man at that     time, which has made him worse. MMSE performed including other cognitive tests which had a poor result although psychiatrist     states he was very distressed at the time which was likely impacting the results.     Psychiatrist letter back to GP outlines three main differentials, firstly OCD, although noted doesn't act on rumination, second     delusional disorder although thinks may be egosyntonic after wife's admission, third depression but doesn't think it meets criteria.     1.

Candidates had the opportunity to   do well on this question as it was very fair. Many however, only made a cursory or no reference to the history of ECT   which is quite relevant in a tutorial about ECT.    The question of prescribing patterns and auditing provided a good opportunity for reflective practice. Most candidates   were aware of the benefits of peer support, RANZCP guidelines and, processes to explore the problem presented. <<<

 MEQ 2  MEQ 2 vignette covered a key topic in child and adolescent psychiatry and one that should have been included  In the range of experiences had by candidates during their child and adolescent rotation. This question would  easily have identified candidates who had spent time exploring ways of conducting assessments with children  during their child and adolescent rotation. Additionally, this question covered both ethical and professional  issues.  The cohort did not perform well on this MEQ. There was limited ability to consider the broader function of  assessment in terms of generating a biopsychosociocultural and spiritual formulation; emphasis was on  diagnosis out of context. There was a tendency toward paternalistic approaches in dealing with a struggling  junior colleague. Candidates also struggled to adapt knowledge and experience to the specific context of the  question.  A large number of responses suggested that different forms of abuse could be discerned through projective  testing, without qualifying that projective testing should be a part of the broader and more comprehensive  assessment of the child and their experiences. There was a tendency to not actually answer the question, but  rather discuss the importance of play in general, or to focus on the practical aspects of the presentation rather  than the content.  MEQ2.2 presented as particularly problematic with a relatively high proportion of no response provided.  Additionally, the examiner feedback indicated some unintended difficulties. MEQ2.2 was subsequently excluded  from the exam results for all candidates The intended proportional contribution of the MEQ section of the exam  to the Total score was preserved by scaling the MEQ scores to the equivalent of the intended contribution of  140 marks.   MEQ 3   GP referral for assessment of paranoia. long description of a 20 year old patient, parents divorced due to   domestic violence when patient was 15. He is drinking 10 standard drinks with friends at the pub. He likes to   collect action figurines. He doesn't leave the house because he had one episode of his heart racing and he   thought he was going to die. In high school has seen the school psychologist because he was bullied.   1. Possible diagnoses   2. Assessment   3. You diagnose him with panic disorder, agoraphobia and alcohol use disorder. He is reluctant to consider   medication. He has a case manager. Discuss immediate management. MEQ 3 This vignette was based on very realistic clinical scenario with which all candidates should be familiar. There were some very comprehensive answers allowing for candidates to accrue marks easily. However, there were many candidates who did not address the details of the vignette. MEQ 3 question enabled markers to discriminate between candidates demonstrating knowledge and clinical expertise. Psychological concerns or the impact of childhood trauma were inadequately addressed. In general, there were only limited descriptions of the different anxiety diagnoses, and of alcohol related disorders. Few described more than one possible Personality disorder cluster. Social concerns and rurality were recognised as salient aspects of this question. <<<
  MEQ 4   Patient on Clozapine 400mg for 15 years. he complains of feeling tired. wants to stop medications.   1. How would you approach his request   2. You agree to stop Clozapine, how would you manage this   3. A medical student is asking you about how to stop antipsychotics and what kind of symptoms are patients     like to experience when antipsychotics are stopped or changed   MEQ 4   This vignette tested candidates' factual knowledge in changing from clozapine to an alterative   antipsychotic. It also tested the candidates' ability to recognise the need for a collaborative approach with   the patient, family, and case manager in the decision-making process. This MEQ was well answered and   demonstrated core knowledge in everyday practice. There was ample opportunity in the marking guide to   obtain marks.   In general, candidates were not able to identify the need for a collaborative approach in decision making   regarding a change in medication or non-pharmacological approaches in the treatment of chronic   psychosis. Simply listing relevant areas resulted in no marks awarded. MEQ 5 - on website   MEQ 5   19 year old Brooke presents with a paracetamol overdose. History of DSH. She was subject to CSA by   grandfather for a number of years. She overdosed on the day that she had to attend a family gathering.   1. Immediate management plan   2. Risk associated with hospitalization   3. Brooke's psychologist calls your registrar and gives details about the recovered memory therapy they are   providing. The registrar is calling you to discuss. The task is to discuss the ethical issues. <<<
 MEQ 5  Candidates performed well on this MEQ. The vignette was a common and simple presentation in  emergency rooms in a busy hospital that needed to be handled sensitively and appropriately managed. A  large proportion of the cohort did not answer distress reduction strategies well and did not offer temporary  respite for the patient.  Many candidates failed to provide justification for their responses, despite instructions clearly stating that  no marks would be awarded without justification. Guidelines - deliberate self harm General feedback    All of the MEQs addressed clinical scenarios which are encountered in clinical practice in Australia and    New Zealand. Overall, better performances were seen in the curriculum areas of assessment, specific    disorders (anxiety), psychology, philosophy and psychodynamic principles, leadership, governance and    legal frameworks. Statistics on curriculum performance also showed that candidates demonstrated a    relatively poor understanding of ethics, history and philosophy, and specific disorders (trauma and stress    related and dissociative).    Candidates are reminded of the importance of reading the question carefully and including answers    specific to the questions being asked whilst maintaining overall perspective. At junior consultant standard,    answers are required to reflect a capacity to appreciate both broad issues and specific perspectives, and    an understanding of clinical governance. Candidates are encouraged to use supervision opportunities to    discuss consultant perspectives in their daily clinical work and to seek advice and formative feedback on    practice answers.   In all MEQs, there were numerous instances where the candidate had not read the instruction clearly.    Time management and pacing is important in examination preparation to ensure all questions are   answered in the allocated time.   As usual, there were instances where markers had major trouble deciphering candidates' handwriting.   We strongly recommend that candidates are mindful of their handwriting to ensure marks are not missed   because the examiner cannot decipher what had been written. Aug 2019 <<<
 MEQ 1  You are a consultant psychiatrist in a CMHT. Young male Jared (? Age 26). First episode  psychosis 8 years ago- only one prior hospital admission. Recently returned from  interstate. Living with parents. Working at a radio station.  On CTO  Paliperidone depot 150mg  CTO due for expiry in 4 weeks time  1.1     What information (list and justify) would you seek from case manager   1.2    What information (list and justify) would inform your treatment decisions  1.3     Jared wants to know about long-term consequences of Paliperidone   1.4    What is the evidence for the use of Community Treatment Orders MEQ 1 The first MEQ presented a straight forward scenario of a patient's concerns regarding the long term complications/risks of antipsychotic medication. This scenario could be expected as one that the candidates would encounter regularly in their clinical practice. It asked the candidate to deal with a specific patient concern, and what they would do (rather than what they theoretically know). Candidates performed relatively well on this MEQ. Most candidates were able to identify long term complications of the medication use. Most candidates provided a rationale rather than just a listing, and understood the need to evaluate risk and current mental state. While many candidates spoke at length about the risk, they often did not address whether or not there were legal grounds to continue to treat the person under the MHA. Very few considered addressing risk benefit analysis in response to the patient, and only a couple addressed the evidence level available. Consideration of non-pharmacological treatment options often did not occur. <<<
  MEQ 2   You are a junior consultant psychiatrist (? Working in CMHT). You are supervisor to Sarah, a Stage 2 trainee.   2.1 List the roles/duties/purpose of the supervisor in this context as per the RANZCP supervisor principles   Sarah wishes to complete an observed interview to contribute to CALD EPA. Using patient, Iranian, mother of 2   children. Requires an interpreter.   2.2 Outline the general principles when using an interpreter   2.3 Outline effective methods of giving feedback (as a supervisor)   Patient from interview is on an antipsychotic medication (medication name not mentioned). Patient's QTc (corrected)   is 450msec.   2.4 Outline your management to the registrar of the QTc result MEQ 2 MEQ 2 was predominately concerned with governance. It also covered clinical aspects (working with interpreters, ECG findings). Candidates performed least well on this MEQ. The majority of candidates simply listed their responses without a rationale when they were expected to explain and discuss. There was a lack of demonstrated knowledge around multifactorial etiology of prolonged QTc, approach to investigation and management. There was a good understanding of the requirements for protected time and working through assessment requirements. Supervision and feedback is a core skill needed by psychiatrists from their first day of employment, and thus an important aspect of training to be assessed. This is an important area to examine each candidate's knowledge base.   MEQ 3   24 marks   37 electrician living at home with elderly parents features of OCD checking switches and electrical appliances as   worried about having a fire, short term limited engagement with the community team and then disengaged multiple   times in the past, failed engagement and past many treatment trials.   A) Outline (list) factors for poor engagement with MHS   B) Describe psychological interventions/ management plan   C) approach to pharmacological management to OCD <<<
   MEQ 3    This vignette was based on important basic knowledge that all candidates should be familiar with. There was    opportunity for candidates to present information that could be drawn from clinical experience, as well as    textbook knowledge. The majority of candidates performed well.    The candidates demonstrated strengths in their capacity to think through the assessment requirements of    a patient with a chronic anxiety disorder, and in their written communication skills. The format of responses    to the 'justify' and 'explain' prompt was better than in previous examinations. Most candidates in the cohort    knew the overall approach to treatment. There was a good understanding of individual/patient factors, and    overall a good standard of responses.    Despite the question mentioning issues relating to the patient's parents, a number of candidates seemed to    ignore the role of carers in supporting care and were not mindful of their needs. Candidates tended to    communicate very rudimentary descriptions of CBT/ERP, and had haphazard approaches to    pharmacotherapy.    Many candidates rewrote/reiterated sections from the stem which is unnecessary. Many candidates made    a number of assumptions about the patient from the stem, and wrote at length from that standpoint e.g.    assumptions about cultural and socioeconomic background.   MEQ 4   24 marks   22 y.o male, university student Jason. Referred by GP. Has history of depression with prior trials of antidepressants.   Past hospital admissions for suicidal ideation. States he has been unable to complete university course work due to   recent symptoms. Referred with distress, teariness, low mood.   Housemate concerned re "picky" eating behaviours and frequent purging   1) What information (list and justify) do you require in assessing this patient   Discloses to you on interview that he has been triggered by university modules around sexual abuse. Discloses that he   was sexually abused by an older cousin at the age of 12. You are the only person he has disclosed this to.   2) How do you respond (list and explain) to this disclosure   Jason completes two outpatient sessions through a Sexual Assault counselling service. He is doing ?slightly better.   3) Discuss (list and debate) other psychological therapies he may benefit from at this point. Prepare 4 RANZCP <<<
 MEQ 4  This vignette involved the assessment and treatment of a specific disorder. It reflected a commonly  encountered and important clinical scenario. The question was clear in wanting information around  psychological treatment rather than general management.  Most candidates indicated a sensitive approach to the patient's disclosure of past abuse. There was a   good understanding of the range of psychological treatments and what they entailed. However, some   candidates took a very narrow approach and did not justify their answers. Significance of developmental  history, family history and collateral history was often ignored by many candidates, and demonstrated   poor focussed training.  Many responses overlooked the immediate management of the presentation. Much of the discussion   about confidentiality versus disclosure/mandatory reporting was poorly considered. Generally, candidates  made presumptive diagnoses rather than addressing formulation and provisional diagnoses.   MEQ 5   18 marks   You are a junior consultant psychiatrist working with the community Old Age Team. You are referred Mrs Hilton, 69 y.o   married female who lives at home with her husband Mr Hilton. Mr Hilton attends the appointment with his wife, with   her permission.   She has been diagnosed with Early Alzheimer's dementia.   Mr Hilton wishes to manage his wife at home.   1) List and explain key factors in managing dementia in the home   2) List and explain non-pharmacological strategies for managing aggression in the home MEQ 5 Candidates performed best on this MEQ. They showed a good understanding of basic principles associated with carer support in dementia, a very common clinical scenario. Responses were required to have a strong focus on non-medical approach to behavioural issues of dementia. Many candidates failed to provide justification for their responses, despite instructions clearly stating that no marks would be awarded without justification. This MEQ required candidates to demonstrate their ability to prioritise information with reference to the scenario, and to synthesise relevant concepts to provide a clear and coherent response. Some indicators of general time management issues were evident given the brevity of many responses, and some candidates not attempting the question. <<<
  Final comments   Overall, better performances were seen in the curriculum areas of assessment, specific disorders   (psychosis), old age, sociocultural awareness and treatments in psychiatry. Statistics on curriculum   performance also showed that candidates demonstrated a poor understanding of professional   communication and liaison, leadership, governance and legal frameworks.   Candidates are reminded of the importance of reading the question carefully, and including answers   specific to the questions being asked, yet maintaining overall perspective, for example, considering the   context and broader outcomes. At junior consultant standard, answers are required to reflect a capacity to   appreciate both broad issues and specific perspectives, and an understanding of clinical governance.   Candidates are encouraged to use supervision opportunities to discuss consultant perspectives in their   daily clinical work, and to seek advice and formative feedback on practice answers.   In all MEQs, there were numerous instances where the candidate had not read the instruction clearly,   often failing to gain marks for not heeding the instruction, such as 'list and justify'.   Time management and pacing is important in examination preparation to ensure all questions are   answered in the time given.   As usual, there were a few instances where markers had major trouble deciphering candidates'   handwriting. We strongly recommend that candidates be mindful of their handwriting to ensure marks are   not missed because the examiner cannot decipher what has been written. Feb 2019   MEQ1   71y male major depression somatic complaints.

  MEQ 1    The first MEQ featured a vignette involving the assessment and treatment of a specific disorder. It reflected a   commonly encountered clinical scenario.    This was the best performing MEQ in the February exam. In general, candidates identified appropriate risks    associated with the elderly and associated risks of depression.   However, most candidates did not consider that inpatient treatment would have allowed for more frequent observation   and investigations. Very few took note of the history of poor response to treatment so far. Candidates needed to   demonstrate that they were giving instructions to the nurses as doctors addressing the priorities for the patient's care,    and many failed to do so. Instead of identifying the key factors relevant at this point in time for the patient's immediate   care, many gave answers such as 'advise the nursing staff to respect the patient because he was elderly' and    speculated on possible additional issues for an elderly patient such as hearing loss although this had not been in the    scenario. Many did not identify key observations such as monitoring sleep.     MEQ 2     Lady with postnatal depression x2 with two children wants another baby. On venlaxine 225mg. Husband     ambivalent about baby.     - Wants to stop her antidepressant what issues will you discuss (10)     - Husband doesn't want baby and comes to meeting. How would you facilitate discussion (6)     - She's 8 weeks pregnant and she stopped meds (GP confirmed pregnancy). She irritable, low mood,        early morning wakefulness. How would you manage her ? (10)   MEQ 2   Most candidates considered the structure and techniques of the psychiatric interview for the given scenario and   displayed an understanding of the complexities of the situation and how to facilitate guided discussion. Multiple    aspects of clinical care needed to be addressed. Generally candidates either answered history clarification or the   medication discussion well, but not both. Many candidates considered family violence - it is encouraging to see that   awareness of this very important factor is increasing.   A large number of candidates seemingly did not read the question carefully and missed points. Others identified a   range of issues but failed to justify their answers. There was apparently poor knowledge of antidepressant safety in   pregnancy and after birth for the baby and if breast feeding, and poor knowledge of school refusal. Many candidates   appeared to lose sight of the need to take the perspective of a junior consultant psychiatrist in this situation. Many   missed the key issue of providing psycho-education to the couple. Read Maudsley Osce station <<<
MEQ 3 Maria is a 25 year old female with epilepsy (partial and complete seizures) that is treatment resistant. Lives with parents in a country town. Intellectual impairment with IQ of 65. Presents in status epilepticus and goes to ICU. She then accuses nurses of spying on her, talking about her, poisoning her food. - What information would you expect the psychiatry registrar to collect (12) - List and justify diagnostic possibilities (6) - Neurologist says she's continue to have seizures and needs to stay. Nurses state they want her    moved as her behaviours are causing distress to other patients. How would you manage this    situation? (10) MEQ 3 MEQ 3 in its entirety covered the scope of assessment, diagnostic formulation, and management in the setting of consultation-liaison psychiatry. This question required the candidate to delineate the roles of registrar and those of the junior consultant psychiatrist. There was an opportunity to demonstrate a good understanding of the relationship between epilepsy and psychosis - core knowledge at this level. The question pertaining to management provided candidates an opportunity to draw on their clinical experience in training as much as their recall of factual knowledge. The question seemed to identify candidates who had derived enough learning from their training experience. All parts of the question allowed candidates to obtain further marks by demonstrating breadth and depth of understanding. Candidates demonstrated a framework for considering the relationship between epilepsy and psychosis, as well as other relevant medical and social comorbidities. Candidates generally understood the different roles of a consultation-liaison psychiatrist, including the need to enquire into and facilitate the alleviation of ward staff anxieties. Most candidates were aware of the need to involve families and carers, although sometimes this was restricted to more paternalistic applications. Few candidates saw the family as a resource to enrich clinical understanding or collaborate in formulating a therapeutic response to the situation. Many answers suggested that candidates had not read the question or the vignette carefully. A number of candidates had not considered the requirements of a "list and explain" question or, responded as if the patient were still in ICU. Few candidates considered the social context of the patient and her family and the implications of coming from a regional area to a tertiary hospital. <<<
 MEQ 4  Shia something (doesn't mention she's an immigrating). 42, has one child who's 3. Stopped working  as a university tutor and looking after her child. Husband working away a lot. Presenting with  abdominal pain, muscle cramps worse on exertion, poor sleep, low mood.  You are the consultant in community overdose clinic and she took an amitriptyline overdose  - Differentials with justification (10)  - Husband comes and says he does not want to see psychiatrist as community will stigmatise. What     are the causes of stigma in this case (6)  - Does not attend follow up. List and justify the issues around non-engagement what you would     discuss with your supervisor (10) MEQ 4  The scenario was one that practicing psychiatrists would be expected to encounter commonly, attempting to  address mood disturbance in the context of stigma and cross-cultural psychiatry. Almost all candidates recognised that the symptoms might represent a depressive illness. Candidates who answered well demonstrated a grasp of  potential risks to patient and child plus risk of domestic violence. They had a grasp of the need for assertive follow  up and some sense of the dilemma posed by the apparent choice made by patient and her husband. The more  sophisticated candidates could self-reflect on how they may have been in the original assessment, how that might  feel any therapeutic blindness and how to attempt to remedy. Most of the cohort struggled to recognise cultural issues and the possibility of a somatoform disorder. When identified, the justification was poor. Many showed little understanding of the potential tension in the marriage for a couple who might have transitioned from a culture with a very different gender bias. More complex issues such as  clinical perception and service access were also rarely mentioned.   MEQ 5   Toby is 25 year old male who has come to ED late at night requesting a repeat diazepam scripts (with 7   repeats). He has no previous history with services.   - What information do you expect the registrar to have obtained ? (10)   - He becomes aggressive and threatens to self harm saying he's being treated by a junkie. How would      you manage this situation. (7)   - He doesn't attend his outpatient appointment and the registrar is informed that the hospital has      received a complaint from his poor care of ED and want a response from this. How would you advise      your registrar. (7) <<<
  MEQ 5   This MEQ was a good question to test skills around not only clinical management but also managing a difficult   patient, addressing governance and supervising/supporting trainees.   The majority of candidates managed to consider the registrar's state of mind and perceptions about being   complained about. In general the cohort appeared to miss the patient aspects in the scenario and focussed rather   on the complaint and on the registrar. Many candidates were unable to demonstrate appreciation of the key   issues in this scenario such as assessing the competency of a junior registrar on the phone; the need to specifically   mention that one will see the patient with the registrar, and the need to provide debriefing, feedback and   supervision for such an emotionally-charged incident. Candidates who failed to address these issues scored very   low in this question.   This MEQ was not well answered overall. Many candidates failed to provide justification for their responses,   despite instructions clearly stating that no marks would be awarded without justification. A small number of   candidates did not complete the final question, possibly due to time constraints, and this MEQ was the poorest   performed in the February 2019 Essay-style exam paper.  Final comments  Overall, better performances were seen in the curriculum areas of assessment, old age, anxiety and epidemiology.   Statistics on curriculum performance also showed that candidates only poorly demonstrated understanding of   addiction, consultation liaison, leadership, governance and legal frameworks.   Candidates are reminded of the importance of reading the question carefully, and including answers specific to the  questions being asked, yet maintaining overall perspective, for example, considering the context and broader   outcomes. At junior consultant standard, answers are required to reflect a capacity to appreciate both broad issues   and specific perspectives, and an understanding of clinical governance. Candidates are encouraged to use   supervision opportunities to discuss consultant perspectives in their daily clinical work, and to seek advice and  feedback on practice answers.  In all MEQs, there were numerous instances where the candidate had not read the instruction clearly, often failing  to gain marks for not heeding the instruction, such as "list and justify".   Time management and pacing is important in exam preparation to ensure all questions are answered in the time   given.  As usual, there were a few instances where markers had major trouble deciphering candidates' handwriting. We   strongly recommend that candidates be mindful of their handwriting to ensure marks are not missed because the  examiner cannot decipher what has been written. Aug 2018 <<<
MEQ 1 You are a consultant In a community health centre. Your patient is a 39 y.o lady with a history of schizophrenia. Despite good adherence to medication she continues to have distressing auditory hallucinations. She is on 6mg of oral risperidone at night. She complains of EPSE. She requests a change of medication 1. outline your approach On examination she has rigidity and tremor. 2. outline your approach to management You change her to clozapine. After 3 weeks she is on 200mg per day and attends for review. She experiences an episode where she felt hot and cold. Her wcc trop t and ck are normal. Her qtc interval has increased from 450 to 492. Her physical obs are normal. 3. outline your management You keep her on clozapine. Three days later she is admitted to ICU. Her mother who is her next of kin accuses you of negligence 4. outline your response and what you would discuss with the family MEQ 1 The first MEQ featured a vignette involving the assessment and treatment of a specific disorder. It reflected a commonly encountered clinical scenario. This was the best performing MEQ in the August exam. In general, candidates identified appropriate risks associated with exacerbation of psychotic symptoms. However, most candidates did not address capacity or non-medication treatment options. A significant number of candidates also did not mention what they would do with clozapine dosing in the given scenario, nor refer to any outcome measures. Involvement of the patient's general practitioner, care giver, case manager and multidisciplinary meeting to draw up a management plan, was only touched on by a few candidates. MEQ 2 CL psychiatrist. Kelly is a 4 years old girl, with 2 older siblings (both are pre-teens), live with parents. Kelly was admitted to paediatric ward, and she was diagnosed with malignant tumour. Her father, Wayne, became very angry, irritable, and appeared to be hearing voices. Kelly was scared because of dad's behaviour. 1.   Discuss your approach. 2.   List and outline possible cause of Wayne's behaviour. 3.   Describe and debate the ethical issues in this case <<<
MEQ 2 This question was complex with layers of issues needing to be recognized to answer the question appropriately. Most candidates did not grasp the ethical issues around this clinical scenario, and the average score of the cohort for the ethics component of the question was low at 40%.  The responses tended to reflect the specifics of the case poorly. The actions suggested proceeded too quickly to highly intrusive interventions such as involuntary assessment of the father and child safety reporting. Many responses did not deal with the consultation aspects of the setting or consider the broad range of other people who may be able to assist in resolving the dilemma posed by the question.  MEQ 3  You are a community CYMHS consultant. You are asked to see a 6 year old girl. She comes from a violent family  and has been rehomed with a caring foster family. You are asked to see her as she is having troubles sleeping  and says she is hearing voices  1. List and outline your assessment.   2. List (only) the possible causes.  3. List and outline why a diagnosis of a primary psychotic disorder is not likely.  4. What is your management plan.  MEQ 3  MEQ 3 presented a highly relevant scenario which was not too complex. While it was a child and adolescent  question, the need to demonstrate an appreciation of developmental stages, support networks, the role of non-  health organisations, and of the dynamics of diagnosis, are issues relevant to psychiatry across the lifespan.  In general, this was one of the better performing MEQs. Many candidates identified the risks of premature  diagnosis - stigma and inappropriate treatment. Strong candidates were able to cover probabilities of primary  psychosis and differential diagnoses. Most candidates considered multimodal approachs to management and  mentioned seeing the child alone as well as with the foster parents. However, many did not consider  developmental history or medication history as broadly as expected.  A large proportion of the cohort did not comment on the need for shared understanding with all stakeholders and  failed to mention key supports e.g. GP, school, and support agencies. <<<
 MEQ 4   You see a 26 y.o lady at the clinic. She is married and has two young children. She has a history of BPAD and is on   valproate 1500mg and olanzapine 20mg. In her early 20s she had multiple admissions with mania and had had one   episode of psychotic depression. She has been trying to eat healthily but has gained 10kg. she wants to change her   medication   1. Outline your approach to her request. How can you hep her lose weight   2. She wants to start lithium. What will you discuss with her about this.   3. She returns to your clinic explaining that she is now thinking of getting pregnant, outline your advice MEQ 4 The question covered an issue commonly expected to arise in clinical practice. Strategies to address medication related weight gain, and an understanding of the underlying rationale was expected for someone working at a Junior Consultant level. While the candidates demonstrated their knowledge about the use of lithium generally, it was less so in the specific context of pregnancy and breast feeding. This MEQ was not well answered overall. Many candidates failed to provide justification for their responses, despite marking criteria which clearly stated that no marks would be awarded without justification. Additionally, very few candidates provided contextualised responses that would suggest their consideration of the information in the scenario. Many candidates provided generic answers and did not consider issues beyond the pregnancy, such as the wellbeing of the children.  MEQ 5  Emily, a 14 y.o girl who is restricting her dietary intake. She is only eating salads. Her BMI  is 15, and not been eating much at all.  . List and outline what is your initial management plan.  . List the criteria for admission in eating disorder.  . Emily is now admitted. List and outline strategies to prevent refeeding syndrome.  . Emily is well physically and was discharged. Father is a headmaster and frequently not     at home, mother is an interior designer with history of low self-esteem, and issues     about her dieting and body image. Describe your management after discharge. <<<
MEQ 5 MEQ 5 presented a clinical picture of an eating disorder, an important and common psychiatric condition in the  community. Most candidates could demonstrate that they knew the physical consequences of Anorexia Nervosa and the general principles of the guidelines for hospital admission in eating disorders. However, many candidates took an approach that was either superficial or narrowly focussed on the presenting complaint of an eating disorder. There was a lack of consideration of the broader context of the presentation to include developmental, social, legal and family aspects. An often neglected issue was an exploration of treatment preferences. An appreciation of family,  developmental and social factors was lacking in many responses. Balancing patient/family preferences with risk minimisation was sadly absent in many responses. It is appreciated that this question was at the end of an arduous exam and on an area in which possibly few  candidates had had clinical experience, and that this may have been reflected in the often brief and superficial  answers. The relative lack of actual clinical experience was suggested by answers that seemed to reflect some rote learning that was poorly reproduced under pressure. A small number of candidates did not complete the final question due to time restraints and this MEQ was the poorest performed in the August 2018 Essay-style exam paper.                                            Summary ·   Pregnancy, mental health and medication · Managing complaints ·   EDS · Seeing situations broadly (like a consultant) · Child Psychiatry <<<
