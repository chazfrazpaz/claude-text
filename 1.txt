Each dimension scores up to 8 marks. A total of 40 marks is possible.Marking Guide:Dimension 1.

The quote from different points of view.? This quote is a question, not a statement, but it still lends itself to discussingboth sides of the question (in such a world, yes, Borderline PD would stillexist, vs no it wouldn't).• Closing statement summarising, and providing the writer’s overall “conclusions”Ideally we want relevant examples and (if possible) references, and a good overallcoherence and flow in the arguments and discussion.Examples of points that might be included:• Arguing that No, BPD would not exist in such a world – issues to be addressed:! Argue that a higher % of patients diagnosed with BPD are women vs men(75% in women - DSM-IV)! Argue that Diagnostic concepts are driven by societal and cultural issues –e.g. coloured by gender-roles and by political standpoints. Example of a pastcategory that has been altered due to societal pressure: Homosexuality.DSM is descriptive and not all that evidence-based – are some politically-driven categories – e.g. due to the USA need for diagnostic categories forhealthcare funders.!

Also societal expectations about female behaviour – society expects womento be more emotional and encourages this (the reverse for men).! Argue that society devalues women thus adding to their stress and causinglower self-esteem (vulnerability to developing a PD). Examples – differentialpay-rates male:female; largely female jobs (e.g. kindergarten teachersroutinely low paid, fewer women in leadership posts world-wide, legacy ofcenturies of discrimination, etc. if that were redressed, rates BPD would fall.! Finally argue that, partly because of the above, females are far more oftenthe victims of childhood sexual abuse, rape and domestic violence – all riskfactors for BPD. Argue that if that were to cease, rates of BPD would fall.• Opposite side of the argument:! Argue against BPD being caused largely by trauma and adversity. UseLinehan's model of inbuilt lability (a genetically inherited trait) and externalstressors, both causing BPD. So yes, the world might be less adverse towomen, but the rates could still be as high if it's as much caused by inheritedcharacter traits.! Alternatively, could argue that even in an (unrealistically) ideal world, therewill still be sources of trauma causing vulnerability, so still BPD diagnosed.! Politically, not likely to be removed from DSM as the diagnosis is essentialfor funding treatment programmes in USA – so yes, would exist.Dimension 2. FlexibilityThe candidaterestricts essay to anextremely narrowand very rigid lineof argument.0Need some arguments on both sides for this, as above.Comments:Note that candidates can't score higher marks unless they briefly discuss thestrengths and weaknesses of each viewpoint and weigh these up. So presentingvery weak arguments with little or no evidence to back them, and not acknowledgingthat, gets <4 points.Ideally we want statements such as "there is level 1 evidence that..." and "NumerousRCTs have shown that..." etc.But can still score 3 even if the evidence/examples are not evaluated re theirstrength.The candidateconsiders only onepoint of view.1-2The candidateconsiders morethan one point ofview, but thestrengths andweaknesses of theviews are poorlyevaluated.The candidateconsiders morethan one point ofview and thestrengths andweaknesses ofeach view are wellevaluated.3-45-6The candidatedemonstrateshighly sophisticatedability to set out andevaluate >1 point ofview7-84Dimension 3.

Breadth - ability to set psychiatry in a broader context.Candidate shows no awareness of the broaderscientific, social, cultural or historical context.0Comments:Obvious “breadth” areas that may be coveredare:History – of the DSM, esp. re social and culturalpressures altering diagnoses.History of the women's rights movement.Cultural and Social issues – these arenumerous. e.g. the subculture of gender.The politics of the DSM.But also useful to look at how culture affects themaking of this diagnosis and the plight ofwomen. BPD diagnosis might not be made inIran or Pakistan, for example, as women mightnot have much access to mental healthservices there and the doctors in those servicesmight be prejudiced. Or, it might be made in aperjorative manner, as used to be frequent hereas well before treatment programmes improved.Etc. etc.There is a very limited understanding of thescientific, social, cultural or historical context ofpsychiatry or mental illness.1-2The candidate demonstrates an ability tounderstand psychiatry or mental illness in onlyone of the following contexts: broader scientific,socio-cultural, historical context.The candidate demonstrates an ability tounderstand psychiatry or mental illness in twoor more of the following contexts: broaderscientific, socio-cultural, historical context.3-45-6Highly sophisticated scope, demonstrating asuperior understanding of the broader contextof psychiatry or mental illness.7-8Extracted Text THE ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND COLLEGE OF                                PSYCHIATRISTS                 MOCK                WRITTENS                     EXAMINATION            (from the Auckland New Zealand program)                                        2014                                     PAPER I                               Model Answers      Note that these Mock Writtens papers are produced by local psychiatrists with no connection to the Examination Committee and are not vetted, test driven and perfected by   committee in the way that the real papers are.

    Modified Essay Question 1     The information from the neurosurgical ward staff is that Billy is showing no signs of brain injury as     he managed to hammer the screwdriver in between his frontal lobes, doing minimal damage.     Surgery was only to check this and clean the area. They say he has been calm and cooperative.     His community team and GP are shocked and surprised by the self-injury, but say Billy had been     quite stressed and is generally impulsive, with poor judgement. He is managed via a long-term     community-based Compulsory Treatment Order (Mental Health Act).     You find that Billy's mother is away in Australia, and his girlfriend with whom he lives also has     schizophrenia. The community team advise you not to contact her, saying she tends to be very     labile emotionally and they will support her and gather any information they can.     You go to the neurosurgical ward to assess Billy. You find him in a 4-bedded room with no special     nursing watch. He is awake and his head is thickly bandaged. The screwdriver is lying on the     nightstand beside him.     Question 1.2   (9 marks )     Outline how you would approach this situation, including the patient assessment and any     immediate interventions.                                                                                               mark                                                                                     worth                                                                                               (circle)                                                                                                 0      Attitude: A.                                                                                 max. 2       1      Maintain a calm manner and try to engage Billy and develop rapport.                        2      Secure the environment:                                                                    0      Remove the screwdriver - with Billy's permission as it's his property, even if he          1 B.                                                                                 max. 2      says he won't repeat the self-harm.

There are no signs of acute psychosis, and the community team     did not think he had been relapsing.      The SHO repeats the request that Billy be transferred to the psychiatric inpatient unit which is in the     same general hospital, saying "we've done our bit - all he needs now is the antibiotics we've     prescribed".     Question 1.4    (8 marks )     Outline the key factors you would weigh up and the steps you would take, regarding     transferring Billy to the psychiatric unit. Assume there would be enough beds to admit him if     need be.                                                                                                mark                                                                                     worth                                                                                               (circle)      Pros and cons for patient:      Determine whether it would be in his best interests to remain on the                        0      neurosurgical ward: A.                                                                                  max. 2       1      - any medical or surgical reasons to keep him there;                                        2      - vs any disadvantages to him remaining there, such as the staff being        anxious, and less able to appropriately manage a patient with schizophrenia.      Liaison and advocacy:      Determine whether the psychiatric unit can be persuaded to accept him this      soon post-surgery. This would require information, reassurance and advocacy,                0      via liaison with the senior/charge nurse and/or admissions manager (etc.)                   1 B.    The situation needs discussion with registrar's supervisor before a decision, max. 3       2      and with the responsible psychiatrist at the psychiatric unit.                              3      It would be helpful to have the neurosurgical nurse liaise directly with      psychiatric unit nursing staff, possibly with additional nursing liaison if there      were nursing staff on the C-L team.      Medico-legal status and Consent:      Need to determine what Billy's status should be: can he be managed      essentially "voluntarily" with the Community Treatment Order continuing in the      background ready for his discharge home, or does his status need changing to                0      formal inpatient status (the details of this will vary depending on local mental            1 C.   health act provisions)? This should also be discussed with supervisor and the max. 3        2      relevant psychiatric staff.                                                                 3      Unless his Mental Health Act status is altered, Billy needs to consent to the      plan if he is to be moved. Ideally he needs to be provided with information and      be part of the decision. If he were uncooperative and had higher-risk plans, his      Mental Health Act status would need review.      Pragmatics:                                                                                 0 D.

MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION                                      2 Modified Essay Question 2 (26 marks) You are working on a Community Mental Health Centre (CMHC). Danny is a 22 year old indigenous man who has been treated voluntarily for a first episode of psychosis. He presented to mental health services for the first time three months ago after acting bizarrely at his local church. Before this incident Danny had been smoking cannabis with his cousin. His grandmother (who raised him, with his grandfather) says that he had no previous mental health problems but had a difficult childhood as he was physically abused by his father, and his mother died from rheumatic fever when he was 12. The Crisis Team assessed him and considered him psychotic. He was commenced on olanzapine 10mg daily which appeared to reduce his symptoms, and referred to the CMHC team for follow up. Before your first scheduled meeting you are contacted urgently by phone, by Danny's grandfather. Danny has been at the church again threatening churchgoers, saying they were not following the 'true path'. He said he was hearing God's voice directing him. Since starting olanzapine he has been spending more time alone. His grandfather says that he was heard muttering to himself in his room and he has been praying more, and clutching a Bible. You get as much detail as you can from Danny's grandfather and from the psychiatric records. Question 2.1 (11 marks) Outline how you would now go about arranging to do an urgent home-based Risk Assessment with Danny, and the key issues you would want to address at this assessment.

MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION 4 Modified Essay Question 4: (24 marks) When on call one night, you are asked by the Emergency Department houseofficer to see Paul, a 45 year old university mathematics lecturer. Paul has no past psychiatric history but was brought to the hospital after police happened on him in a local cemetery, attempting to hang himself from a tree. He did no injury to himself as he was interrupted before completing the attempt. Paul tells you that he no longer wants to live since his wife and their two children were killed in a helicopter crash two months ago. The helicopter was piloted by his father-in-law, who also died in the accident. Paul was not with them - his wife and children were on holiday at his father-in-law's sheep station. Paul has no siblings or other close family. His parents are both dead, his mother when he was aged 11, of cancer, and his father a year ago from a heart attack. Paul now lives alone and says he has drifted away from his prior friends, and has no real supports. Paul appears sad but talks freely. He says that he has made a reasoned decision to end his life, as without his family "there's nothing to live for". He denies any anxiety symptoms and when asked if he feels depressed, says "of course: wouldn't you be? But I'm not crazy and I'm not sick, if that's what you mean." Question 4.1 (2 marks) Based on the information in the vignette, if Paul has a psychiatric diagnosis, what would the two main differentials be?                                                                                    mark                                                                           worth                                                                                   (circle)                                                                                      0 A     Adjustment disorder with depressed mood                             max. 1     1                                                                                      0 B     Major depressive episode                                            max. 1     1                                                 Up to a maximum of 2 marks total                                                                            Total: Note to Examiners: Please mark all boxes.                                                                                         18 <<<
Modified Essay Question 4 You assess Paul, who has low mood and hopelessness regarding the future, but few vegetative symptoms of depression. He has some initial insomnia and admits to his sleep being relatively unrefreshing: "I wake up in the morning and for a second it's OK, then it hits me again: they're gone". He is making himself eat and has not lost weight. In the three weeks he has resumed work as a lecturer and finds that he can concentrate and manage a day's work. He says that it helps a little, as a distraction, but "feels pretty pointless". He has not attempted theoretical mathematical work, but can cope with basic lectures. There are no symptoms of any other psychiatric disorder and he does not drink or use drugs. He has no religious beliefs. Paul is clear that he sees no point in continued existence, and intends to make another suicide attempt as soon as he can.

    Modified Essay Question 5     No physical or neurological cause is found for Harry's behavioural change.

     MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION                                      6      Modified Essay Question 6: (18 marks)      Mr Klaus Larsen, a 44 year old man receiving a sickness benefit, has been referred to you at a Community Mental Health      Service by his new General Practitioner (GP). Mr Larsen has a history of recurrent major depression, having had three      episodes since age 35. He has moved to the city from a smaller rural community where he used to be a dairy farmer until      becoming too depressed to maintain the farm. He and his wife have relocated to a nearby suburb and she has found work      in an accountant's office. They are hopeful, the GP's letter says, that the greater resources available in the city will help      Mr Larsen more with his depression.      He has been depressed for nine months now, treated with paroxetine 60mgs mane, this having been increased from      20mgs to 40mgs then 60mgs mane across a three month period due to poor response.      Although he improved to a degree on this medication, such that appetite and sleep are somewhat better, he remains low      in energy, with poor concentration and motivation, anxious and pessimistic ruminations and mild diurnal variation, being      slower and more preoccupied in the mornings.      He has had two prior episodes - the first at age 30 followed a change in governmental agricultural policy which came      close to bankrupting him due to loss of subsidies, and was then treated with a four month course of amitriptyline to which      he responded but recalls severe sedation and dizziness. This was followed by another recurrence of depression at age 39      when the district was threatened with a foot and mouth scare and there was talk of slaughtering animals as a precaution.      On this second occasion his GP prescribed 20 mgs paroxetine and he responded to this across two months, remaining on      it for four years as he feared a recurrence. He then tapered and ceased it due to sexual side effects.      He has had no other form of treatment across the years, apart from short courses of hypnotics when the depressions      were severe.      Question 6.1      (6 marks )      In assessing Mr Larsen's recurrent and hard to treat depression, outline which aspects of      history review your assessment would include.                                                                                                                  mark                                                                                                      worth                                                                                                                  (circle)                                                                                                                     0       Detailed psychiatric, medical and personal history from Mr Larsen including his                               1 A     medication history & adherence, insight and any underlying psychological or                    max. 3         2       personality factors that might be perpetuating his depression.                                                3                                                                                                                     0 B     History to review his Risk Assessment.                                                         max. 1         1       Review his alcohol & drug use history, especially the amount of alcohol used,                                 0 C                                                                                                    max. 1       and any sequelae.                                                                                             1       Collateral history:                                                                                           0       .

Make sure you do read the exams section of the College website to be clear about how the real thing is in fact marked. E.g. 1/2 marks are not allowed in the real writtens, so examiners are forced to stick more strictly to the marking templates with less room for "fudging". In the real exams all questions are as evidence-based as possible, and we tried to manage this where we could, but some questions are less EBM-rigorous and are based more on extensive clinical experience. You will not agree with all the model answers, but then that very likely parallels the real writtens as well.                                                                                1 <<<

KEY FEATURE CASES Case 3           (6 marks) Joseph, aged 39, presents for the assessment of low mood. Routine questioning reveals that he has a strong compulsion to drink alcohol; routinely drinks larger amounts of alcohol than he intended; and that he has been unable to cut down this consumption. Joseph further reports that he spends a considerable amount of time drinking and recovering from drinking, to the extent that he has had to cut back on his work hours. Question 1 In your assessment of Joseph, what are other KEY areas to address when considering a diagnosis of alcohol dependence? List UP TO THREE. (4 marks) SCORING KEY A. Symptoms of tolerance. B. Symptoms of withdrawal. C. Continued use of alcohol despite clear evidence of harmful consequences.    Algorithm                                       Scoring Key    A = 1                                            1 mark for ONE of the three answers    B = 1                                           2 marks for TWO of the three answers    C = 1 mark                                      4 marks for ALL THREE answers    A + B = 2 marks                                 0 marks for MORE THAN THREE answers    A + C = 2 marks    B + C = 2 marks    A + B + C = 4 marks    More than 3 answers = 0 marks. Explanatory notes to marker: This question tests the candidates knowledge of the diagnosis of alcohol dependence as conceptualized by DSM- IVR and ICD 10 both of which are based on the theories of Edwards and Gross (all in Schuckit and Kaplan and Saddock). The history gives the other criteria for the diagnosis. DSM-IV-R has seven major criteria to look for in the history. Joesph's history gives criteria 3-6, so 1, 2 and 7 (tolerance, withdrawal, and continued use despite being aware of the problems it causes) are what is being looked for. ICD-10 has six major criteria, which are the DSMIV criteria grouped together plus craving or a sense of compulsion. Joseph's history is missing criteria 3,4, and 6 (tolerance, withdrawal, and continued use despite being aware of the problems it causes). If tolerance and withdrawal are grouped together as one item (indicating physiological dependence) this was marked as being correct for two points The most common mistake was including features of alcohol abuse or the CAGE questionnaire. Question 2 Joseph asks if his drinking might have caused his depression. What is THE KEY area in the history to explore when trying to distinguish an independent depression from a depression secondary to alcohol use? Write ONE answer only. ( 2 marks ) SCORING KEY     A. The key area in the history is establishing the temporal link between alcohol use and depression. If         the depression is only seen while drinking and remits in abstinence it is probably secondary. If it         preceded the commencement of the alcohol problems and is unaffected by abstinence then it is         probably independent.    Algorithm                                       Original Scoring Key                                                     1 mark for the temporal link                                                     1/2 mark for each elaboration of this link as noted above Explanatory note to marker: Schuckit, Kaplan and Saddock, and DSM IV all emphasize the temporal link, rather than specific symptoms, the dose of alcohol, or risk factors for either disease as being the key way to differentiate. DSM IV further specifies the length of abstinence (four weeks). Candidates almost universally identified this link, but did not elaborate both elements of this: which came first and whether the depression remitted in abstinence.                                                                                                                 18 <<<

KEY FEATURE CASES  Case 7           (6 marks) On starting work at a new community team, you pick up the care of Sheree, a 29 year old woman. Her file states that she has an eight-year history of schizoaffective disorder, with six past admissions. She has a history of extensive sexual and emotional abuse in childhood. Her main symptoms are persistent low mood, suicidal ideation, insomnia, cutting of the forearms, overvalued ideas of a persecutory nature which have during her admissions been of delusional intensity, and intractable derogatory auditory hallucinations. She has never had manic symptoms. She is treated with IM fluphenazine decanoate 50mgs monthly, oral olanzapine  20 mgs daily, clonazepam 0.5 mgs QID, lithium carbonate 1000 mgs nocte and fluoxetine 60 mgs mane. After reading the file, you have doubts about her diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder.  Question 1 What is the most likely alternative explanation for Sheree's longstanding symptoms, if she does not in fact have a schizoaffective disorder? (3 marks)  The answer needs to convey three key issues for the 3 marks:     1. The abuse has led to features of Borderline Personality Disorder / or accept Chronic PTSD    2. The abuse has also led to affective instability and lowered moods / dysthymia / depressive episodes    3. The apparent psychotic Sx are more likely to be dissociative in origin and also linked to the abuse (many canddiates interpreted the request for an "alternative explanation" too concretely and just gave  a diffferential Dx, with no explanatory linkage to the serious abuse history. )  You decide to review Sheree's diagnosis and reorganise her treatment. Question 2 Which would be the most important next steps for you to carry out? Select THREE OPTIONS ONLY from the list below.       (3 marks)   A. Tell her case manager about your rediagnosis and plans to alter Sheree's medication   B. Construct a detailed record of her treatment, using timelines to record medications   C. Chart a withdrawal regime for the clonazepam   D. Refer Sheree for sexual abuse therapy  E. Meet with Sheree, assess her and start to establish a therapeutic relationship  F. Rewrite Sheree's Crisis Management plan   G. Cease the IM fluphenazine and allow it to self-taper  H. Arrange a case conference of all the health professionals involved in Sheree's care   I. Present your reformulation and plan to the multidisciplinary team at the next meeting   J. Titrate down and then cease the lithium carbonate across a 4-week period Notes:  Correct answers are B, E and H  Essential to begin to establish a therapeutic relationship and to actually assess her before doing anything else, useful to summarize the past polypharmacy in detail, and a case conference is also useful. A - no, need to assess her first, C - no, not before seing her and reviewing the case more thoroughly, also is too high-handed. D - too precipitate and might be harmful, F - too high-handed - such plans need to be written in consultation with all involved. G - Ceasing IMI depot too high- handed prior to assessing her. I - Telling MDT your views also too high-handed, need a conference  first, not to dictate plan to others at this early stage. J - also too precipitate and would need more time for all involved to agree to this.                                                                                                     22 <<<

SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS Short Answer 14 (4 marks) You decide to embark on a course of cognitive therapy with a patient recovering from depression. Question 1 List in note form Beck's Cognitive Triad. (1 1/2 marks)         ·    Negative view of the self         ·    Negative view of the environment / world         ·    Negative view of the future       1/2 mark for each point Question 2 List in note form five of the 11 common cognitive distortions described by Beck. (2 1/2 marks)        1. ALL-OR-NOTHING THINKING: You see things in black-and-white categories.       2. OVERGENERALIZATION: You see a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.       3. MENTAL FILTER: You pick out a negative detail and dwell on it exclusively. Also = "tunnel vision".       4. DISQUALIFYING THE POSITIVE: You reject positive                  by insisting they "don' t count" for       some reason or other. In this way you can maintain a negative belief that is contradicted by your       everyday experiences.       5. JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS: You make a negative interpretation though there are no definite facts       that convincingly support conclusion.       a. Mind reading: You arbitrarily conclude that someone is reacting negatively to you and you don' t bother       to check this out.       b. The Fortune Teller Error: You anticipate that things will turn out badly, and you feel convinced that       your prediction is an already-established fact.       6. MAGNIFICATION (CATASTROPHIZING) OR MINIMIZATION: You exaggerate the importance of       things (such as your goof-up or someone else' s achievement), or you inappropriately shrink things until       they appear tiny (your own desirable qualities or the other fellow' s imperfections). This is also called the       ' binocular trick'        7. EMOTIONAL REASONING: You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way       things really are: ' I feel it, therefore it must be true.'        8. SHOULD STATEMENTS: You try to motivate yourself with shoulds and shouldn' ts, as if you had to be       whipped and punished before you could be expected to do anything. ' Musts' and ' oughts' are also       offenders. The emotional consequence is guilt. When you direct should statements toward others, you       feel anger, frustration and resentment.        9. LABELING AND MISLABELING: This is an extreme form of overgeneralization. Instead of describing       your error, you attach a negative label to yourself: ' I'm a loser.' When someone else's behavior rubs y       the wrong way, you attach a negative label to him: ' He' s a goddamn louse.' Mislabeling involves       describing an event with language that is highly colored and emotionally loaded.        10. PERSONALIZATION: You see yourself as the cause of some negative external event which in fact       you were not primarily responsible for.        11. SELF-WORTH: You make an arbitrary decision that in order to accept yourself as worthy, okay, or to       simply, feel good about yourself, you have to perform in a certain way; usually most or all of the time.       1/2 mark for each point given, to a max. of 2.5 marks                                                                                                         38 <<<

KEY FEATURE CASES Case 5          (6 marks) You are a consultation-liaison registrar working with an organ transplantation team. You assess Bruce, a 49 year old ex-army major with a history of alcohol dependence who has been ' dry' for 8 months. He has liver failure due to cirrhosis and needs a transplant. The transplant team ask you to assess his suitability and likelihood of remaining abstinent from alcohol post transplant. Bruce is in a stable marriage and his wife is supportive of him attending AA regularly. Bruce says that he now goes to church regularly instead of going to the pub, and is proud that he is "a reformed character". He has a past history of delirium tremens with hallucinations but no other past psychiatric history. Bruce has recently become mildly depressed at the prospect of a long wait for a donor, and has been tearful at times, but he denies any thoughts of suicide and still has some hope for the future. Question 1     (1 mark) Are there any ABSOLUTE CONTRAINDICATIONS to transplantation in Bruce' s case, from the details in the vignette above? Give ONE answer only. Scoring Key: Answer: No (1 mark if correct) Alcoholism as cause of liver failure is not a contraindication (quite common in transplant patients). Past DTs and current depression are not contraindications - the depression is recent, mild, and should be treatable. Only acute suicidality or refractory major psychiatric illness is a contraindication (and the latter only a relative one re Human Rights issues). Question 2     (5 marks) Which KEY FEATURES about Bruce in the vignette as above were identified by Vaillant as likely predictors of future abstinence? Give up to FOUR answers: Scoring Key: Vaillant's key features indicating future abstinence are:    A. Presence of adverse and consistent consequences to drinking (terminal illness, i.e. liver       failure)    B. Person has developed a substitute activity (church and/or AA)    C. Person has a relationship with someone committed to their welfare and rehabilitation (wife       supports AA)    D. Abstinence is a source of improved self-esteem or hope (pride re being "reformed") Scoring guide: 1 mark for each of A, B, C and D All 4 points are conveyed = 5 marks More than 4 answers = 0 NB: the main point of each factor as above needs to be conveyed.

KEY FEATURE CASES Case 6           (6 marks) Julia is a 42 year old woman who has been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder type 2. She lives alone and has no immediate family other than an elderly aunt living in the United Kingdom. Julia works as an office manager and can no longer afford to see her private psychiatrist so has been referred to the public system and this is the first time that you have seen her. For the last three months she has experienced symptoms of depression with melancholic features but with no psychosis. She was commenced on venlafaxine XR six weeks ago by her private psychiatrist and is currently on 300 mgs daily. Julia has no obvious side effects from the venlafaxine but she says that it has not helped and that her depression is worse, and she is insistent that it be ceased. She is taking no other medication and has no significant past medical history. As an initial step you agree to cease venlafaxine and to commence an alternative medication. Question 1    (4 marks) With reference to the available evidence-base, WHICH MEDICATION would you consider instituting for Julia instead of venlafaxine at the first consultation, before obtaining the results of any additional investigations?

Before you can consider any treatment change and while you are waiting for a cardiology assessment, a cardiac ECHO and her previous notes, Julia' s mental state deteriorates.She becomes increasingly hopeless, desperate and suicidal. She cannot keep herself safe and her arms are covered in self-inflicted bruising.

He has lived at home with his parents and has been quietly deluded and thought disordered, with poor functioning. He cannot work, does not drive and spends his time filling notebooks with chemistry pseudo-formulae and deluded scribblings. Martin and his parents refused to consider clozapine due to fears about its potential side-effects, but they have finally agreed, and he is admitted for a clozapine trial. He does very well on clozapine and in 5 weeks is free of psychosis for the first time in 12 years. His parents are delighted but Martin confides to you that he feels that 12 years of his life have been stolen away and that he deeply regrets not having tried clozapine much sooner. Question 1      (2 marks) Other than physical adverse effects, explain the MAIN RISK that you must now watch out for and manage, in Martin's case.

 KEY FEATURE CASES  Case 1           (6 marks)  John, a 43 year old single indigenous man, was admitted one week ago to the inpatient unit  under the Mental Health Act with a relapse of a pre-existing schizophrenic illness. He had been  under the care of a community team but was avoiding appointments and defaulting on treatment  as he had no insight into his illness. Recently he had stayed with a friend, but he has no fixed  address at present.  He appeals against being held under compulsory treatment and a legal review is arranged. At  this review his compulsory treatment in hospital is argued for by his psychiatrist on the basis that the disorganisation associated with John's illness renders him seriously incapable of self care.  John argues (with the help of a lawyer) that he chooses to live a semi-itinerant lifestyle, and that  although his standards are fairly basic, he is not so impaired that compulsory treatment is justified. The judge agrees, and discharges John from compulsory treatment.  Immediately after the hearing, John's distressed father and sister who attended the legal review  and were very unhappy about the outcome, reveal that they are frightened because last night  when they visited, John made a direct threat to kill his mother if she kept sexually assaulting him  at night. They say that they were too afraid of John to tell the judge about this during the hearing.  Question 1 (3 marks)  After the hearing John is demanding that the staff open the door so he can be released from the  unit. His lawyer is supporting his request.  What are the MOST URGENT steps to take at this point. Give UP TO THREE answers.  Answer:     A. Prevent John from leaving the unit     B.

SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS Short Answer 4           (5 marks) Question 1 (5 marks) List in note form the factors delineated by Hill that can indicate causation, in epidemiological studies.  1.   Temporal Relationship:  Exposure always precedes the outcome.  2.   Strength:  The stronger the association, the more likely it is that the relation of "A" to "B" is causal.  3.    Dose-Response Relationship:  An increasing amount of exposure increases the risk. If a dose-response relationship is  present, it is strong evidence for a causal relationship.  4.   Consistency:  The association is consistent when results are replicated in studies in different settings using  different methods.  5.    Plausibility:  The association agrees with currently accepted understanding of pathological processes.  6.    Consideration of Alternate Explanations:  In judging whether a reported association is causal, it is necessary to determine the extent to  which researchers have taken other possible explanations into account and have effectively  ruled out such alternate explanations.  7.   Experiment:  The condition can be altered (prevented or ameliorated) by an appropriate experimental  regimen.  8.   Specificity:  This is established when a single putative cause produces a specific effect. This is considered  by some to be the weakest of all the criteria.  9.   Coherence  The association should be compatible with existing theory and knowledge. In other words, it is  necessary to evaluate claims of causality within the context of the current state of knowledge  within a given field and in related fields. But - remember about "Paradigm Shifts".                                                                                      27 <<<

                 Critical Analysis Question 1                (20 marks) Read the abstract and answer the questions that follow. Age at onset and cognition in schizophrenia: meta-analysis T. K. Rajji, MD, FRCPC, Z. Ismail, MD, FRCPC and B. H. Mulsant, MD, MS, FRCPC Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto and Geriatric Mental Health Program, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Canada The British Journal of Psychiatry (2009) 195: 286-293. doi: 10.1192/bjp.bp. 108.060723 Background The relationship between cognition and age at onset of schizophrenia is largely unknown. Aims To compare cognitive deficits in individuals with youth-onset and late-onset schizophrenia with those in adults with first-episode schizophrenia. Method Twenty-nine databases (including EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO) were searched from 1980 to 2008. Selected publications had to include healthy controls and analyse separately individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or a related disorder and individuals with first-episode, youth-onset (maximum age of onset of 19 years) or late-onset schizophrenia (minimum age of onset of 40 years). Results Individuals with youth-onset and first-episode schizophrenia demonstrate large deficits (mean effect size ≥0.8) on almost all cognitive measures. Individuals with youth-onset schizophrenia demonstrate larger deficits than those with first-episode schizophrenia on arithmetic, executive function, IQ, psychomotor speed of processing and verbal memory. In contrast, those with late- onset schizophrenia demonstrate minimal deficits on arithmetic, digit symbol coding and vocabulary, but larger ones on attention, fluency, global cognition, IQ and visuospatial construction. Conclusions Individuals with youth-onset schizophrenia have severe cognitive deficits, whereas those with late-onset schizophrenia have some relatively preserved cognitive functions. This finding supports the view that severity of the disease process is associated with different ages at onset. In addition, the cognitive pattern of people with late-onset schizophrenia suggests that their deficits are specific rather than solely as a result of ageing and related factors.                                                                                            35 <<<

Younger age of onset is associated with a more marked phenotypic expression of      schizophrenia                                                          concurrent substance abuse, D.   Individuals with younger age of onset have higher rates of      worsening cognitive deficits E.

 Critical Analysis Question 2               (20 marks)  Read the abstract and answer the questions that follow.  Structured risk assessment and violence in acute psychiatric  wards: randomised controlled trial  Christoph Abderhalden, PhD, MNSc Nursing and Social Education Research Unit, University of Bern Psychiatric Services, Berne, Switzerland  The British Journal of Psychiatry (2008) 193: 44-50. doi: 10.1192/bjp.bp. 107.045534  Background  There is a lack of research on the possible contribution of a structured risk assessment to the reduction of aggression in psychiatric in-patient care.  Aims  To assess whether such risk assessments decrease the incidence of violence and coercion.  Method  A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted with 9 acute psychiatric admission wards as  the units of randomisation, (with four wards in the intervention arm and five wards in the control  arm). The intervention comprised a standardised risk assessment following admission with mandatory evaluation of prevention in high-risk patients.  Results Incidence rates decreased substantially in the intervention wards, whereas little change occurred in  the control wards. The adjusted risk ratios suggest a 45% reduction in severe aggressive incidents  and a 27% decline in the use of coercive measures. The severity of aggressive incidents did not  decrease.  Conclusions  Structured risk assessment during the first days of treatment may contribute to reduced violence  and coercion in acute psychiatric wards.                                                                                           39 <<<

Groups of subjects, as opposed to individual subjects, are randomised in the trial       They are randomised controlled trials with individuals, where the data is analysed in clusters E.       and presented as a "cluster graph"       Cluster randomised trials can inflate "false positive" errors (compared to standard F.       randomised controlled trials)       Statistical analysis of cluster randomised controlled trials occurs at the cluster level, and G.       cannot include patient level analysis of data       Cluster randomised trials involve greater complexity in the design and analysis (compared H.      to standard randomised control trials)       Cluster randomised trials can inflate "false negative" errors (compared to standard I.       randomised controlled trials)       A cluster randomised trial requires fewer subjects to achieve the same statistical Power  J.       than does an individually randomised control trial K.    Place-randomised trials is another term for cluster randomised trials       Cluster randomised trials can inflate Type II errors (compared to standard randomised L.       controlled trials) M.

Chen, Zhi Hu, Li Wei, Xia Qin, C. McCracken and J. R. Copeland Background Depression and dementia often exist concurrently. The associations of depressive syndromes and severity of depression with incident dementia have been little studied. Aims To determine the effects of depressive syndromes and cases of depression on the risk of incident dementia. Method Participants in China and the UK aged >65 years without dementia were interviewed using the Geriatric Mental State interview and re-interviewed 1 year later in 1254 Chinese, and 2 and 4 years later in 3341 and 2157 British participants respectively (Ageing in Liverpool Project Health Aspects: part of the Medical Research Council - Cognitive Function and Ageing study). Results Incident dementia was associated with only the most severe depressive syndromes in both Chinese and British participants. The risk of dementia increased, not in the less severe cases of depression but in the most severe cases. The multiple adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=5.44 (95% CI 1.67-17.8) for Chinese participants at 1-year follow-up, and HR=2.47 (95% CI 1.25-4.89) and HR=2.62 (95% CI 1.18-5.80) for British participants at 2- and 4-year follow-up respectively. The effect was greater in younger participants. Conclusions Only the most severe syndromes and cases of depression are a risk factor for dementia. [Excerpt from Methods: Assessment] A computer program assisted diagnosis - the Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy (AGECAT) - was used to analyse the information from the GMS to identify the principal mental disorders in participants. It was developed using a theoretical model and tested against its success at replicating diagnoses on samples diagnosed by psychiatrists. It attempts to replicate the process by which a psychiatrist achieves a syndromal diagnosis followed by a differential diagnosis. ... Individual participants are allocated to levels of confidence of diagnosis (0-5) on each of the eight diagnostic syndromes: organic disorder, depression, mania, schizophrenia and paranoid, obsessional, phobic, hypochondriacal, and general anxiety. ... the various syndrome levels are compared to derive a final differential diagnosis, a level of confidence of diagnosis from 0-5. A level of >3 in most circumstances designates a 'case level' that has been shown to correspond with what psychiatrists usually recognise as a case for intervention. Levels 1 and 2 are designated as 'sub-cases', and level 0 (no confidence level on any syndrome) is classified as 'well'. ... The AGECAT also divides depression into psychotic and neurotic types that appear to equate well with DSM-III/DSM-IV major depression, and dysthymia without the 2-year rule. Although the levels are intended to be levels of confidence of diagnosis, it has been our observation that, in those conditions where diagnosis tends to be on a continuum with normality, for example in cognitive decline and depression, the different levels tend also to reflect levels of severity in terms of type and numbers of symptoms.                                                                                        33 <<<

Am. J. Psych. 2009; 166:875-881. Objective: While several studies have shown that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an efficacious treatment for generalized anxiety disorder, few studies have addressed the outcome of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy, even though this treatment is widely used. The aim of this study was to compare short-term psychodynamic psycho- therapy and CBT with regard to treatment outcome in generalized anxiety disorder. Method: Patients with generalized anxiety disorder according to DSM-IV were randomly assigned to receive either CBT (N=29) or short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (N=28). Treatments were carried out according to treatment manuals and included up to 30 weekly sessions. The primary outcome measure was the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, which was applied by trained raters blind to the treatment conditions. Assessments were carried out at the completion of treatment and 6 months afterward. Results: Both CBT and short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy yielded significant, large, and stable improvements with regard to symptoms of anxiety and depression. No significant differences in outcome were found between treatments in regard to the primary outcome measure. These results were corroborated by two self-report measures of anxiety. In measures of trait anxiety, worry, and depression, however, CBT was found to be superior. Conclusions: The results suggest that CBT and short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy are beneficial for patients with generalized anxiety disorder. In future research, large-scale multicenter studies should examine more subtle differences between treatments, including differences in the patients who benefit most from each form of therapy. [Excerpt from Methods] This study was carried out in the Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy at the Georg-August-University Goettingen between May 2001 and June 2007. It was approved by the ethics committee of the university's school of medicine. After providing their informed consent, the patients were randomly allocated to the two treatment groups. An investigator allegiance effect was controlled for by including representatives of both short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (F. Leichsenring, S.S.) and CBT (E.L., C.W.) in the trial. The inclusion criteria required subjects to be between 18 and 65 years old and to have a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder. Primary diagnosis was defined as the most severe mental disorder according to the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule -Revised. The following exclusion criteria were applied: 1) any acute, unstable, or severe axis III medical disorder that might interfere with the successful completion of treatment, 2) any current or past history of schizophrenic disorder, bipolar disorder, or cluster A or B axis Il disorder, 3) any current or past neurological disorder, 4) alcohol or substance dependence or abuse, an eating disorder, or major depression in the previous 12 months, and 5) current concomitant psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological treatment.                                                                                         37 <<<

Both CBT and short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy included up to 30 (50- minute) sessions and were carried out according to treatment manuals ..... Implementation of the treatment manuals, including adherence to the manuals and competent delivery of the interventions, was ensured for each group of therapists by continuous group supervision, which was carried out every month by supervisors (F. Leichsenring, E.L.) who were highly experienced in CBT or psychodynamic therapy and highly familiar with the respective treatment manual. The supervision included reading and discussing the manual and talking over audiotaped cases or special treatment situations. All of the sessions were audiotaped. From each treatment included, one session was randomly selected and rated by nine independent raters who were provided with extensive information about the two treatment manuals, including their specific treatment elements. Each of the selected sessions was rated blindly by three to eight raters (including U.J., H.K., F. Leweke) with regard to the type of treatment that was applied. The raters identified 26 (89.7%) of 29 CBT sessions correctly as the form of therapy described in the CBT manual and 24 (85.7%) of 28 short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy sessions correctly as the form of therapy described in the short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy manual (overall rate of correct identification, 87.7%). A closer look at the misidentified treatment sessions showed that in these sessions, therapists of both types encouraged the patients to approach feared situations. As previously described, both approaches address feared situations, but they use different rationales. The kappa value for agreement beyond chance was 0.76, ... indicating excellent agreement beyond chance. Question 2.7 Select THREE correct statements, from the list below: (3 marks) (Please select ONLY three options: more than three answers will incur a mark of zero) A.    Kappa coefficient statistics suppose that, when not completely certain, raters simply guess. B.    The kappa coefficient measures test-retest reliability. C.    Kappas are reliably comparable across different studies, procedures, or populations. D.    Kappa statistics are not influenced by trait prevalence (distribution) or base-rates.       Kappa statistics are appropriate for testing whether agreement exceeds chance levels for E.       binary and nominal ratings.       Fleiss's guideline characterizing kappas over 0.75 as excellent, 0.40 to 0.75 as fair to good, F.       and below 0.40 as poor is entirely arbitrary. G.

It is difficult to generalise from this study to normal clinical settings, due to the need for very       experienced therapists prepared to work from a treatment manual. C.    The study's methods would be difficult to implement in normal clinical settings, due to the       need for regular group supervision by very experienced supervisors.                                               differences in outcome between treatments in D.    The study's inability to show significant      regard to the primary outcome is likely to be a Type I error.       It is difficult to generalise from this study, as Generalised Anxiety Disorder is a condition E.       which commonly presents in Primary Care where these therapy resources are not available. F.

    Modified Essay Question 1     The blood and urine tests you order all turn out to be unremarkable. Physical observations are     within normal limits. When you arrive at the rest home, nursing staff tell you that John is continuing     to hallucinate. His overnight sleep has been poor. John is not in pain. Constipation noted after his     arrival at the rest home was successfully treated with laxatives.     On mental state examination, John presents as mildly suspicious. He reports clearly seeing     "intruders" and animals in his bedroom. There is no auditory component associated with these     images. John reports feeling distressed and annoyed by these "intruders", but doesn't think the     "intruders" or anyone else will harm him. He reports feeling "on edge", and objectively looks     anxious. He denies feeling sad, depressed or suicidal.     A Montreal Cognitive Assessment you administer scores 22/30, with marks lost for delayed recall     (-4), visuospatial function (-3), and orientation (-1). His attention and concentration are good. You     notice he has a bilateral hand tremor.     On physical examination there is mild cogwheeling in both upper limbs, but no other abnormality.     He wears an old pair of eyeglasses.     Question 1.3   (4 marks)     Give your preferred diagnosis, plus the most likely differentials.

    MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION 4      Modified Essay Question 4: (22 marks)      You work on a Child and Family Mental Health team and are asked to see Gina, a 14 year old girl     who is in a paediatric ward after being admitted two days ago from school via ambulance. She     became dizzy at school and collapsed. There has been concern about how thin and sad she has     become over the past three months and the school counsellor called her mother recently to say she     thought she may have an eating disorder, after Gina was seen throwing out her lunches. It is     reported that her mother told the counsellor that Gina had a thin build "like the rest of the family" and     that she was being seen by her GP, who wasn't worried about her.      The paediatric ward reports that she is significantly underweight (height 90th percentile, weight less     than 3rd percentile), and her blood pressure, pulse and temperature have all been low but are now     improved. Her white cell count is a little low, but other investigations to date-FBC, renal function,     liver function and electrolytes-are all normal. She has no significant past mental health or medical     history and is taking no medicines other than phosphate and vitamin supplements prescribed by the     ward.     Question 4.1 (4 marks)      Other than eating disorder, list the main differential diagnoses you would want to explore,     and give reasons why.                                                                                                 mark                                                                                      worth                                                                                                (circle)                                                                                                   0                                                                   include               2         1 A     Organic disorder leading to weight loss (causes are varied but      thyrotoxicosis, inflammatory bowel disease, infections and malignancies).                    2                                                                                                   0 B     Major depression - in view of sadness and weight loss.                            2         1                                                                                                   2                                     Up to a maximum of 4 marks in total              TOTAL:     Note to Examiners: Please mark all boxes.                                                                                                    18 <<<

A 24 year old man, Will, with a     diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, has been admitted under your care after being arrested for     manually assaulting his brother-in-law during an argument. At the time of his arrest he was found     with a knife in his possession. He is due to appear in court for this assault and other charges, in     seven days. Will has been under the care of your local mental health service for 6 months after     moving here from another area. He is treated with oral olanzapine. Will has a prior history of assault     about which you have limited information. On admission he appears drunk and refuses to engage in     interview.

    MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION 6     Modified Essay Question 6: (15 marks)     You work on an adult Crisis Service and are asked to meet with the son and daughter of a woman     with no prior contact with mental health services, called Sophia. Sophia is a 53 year old woman who     lives by herself in her own home, with her German Shepherd dog. She was divorced at age 40 and     received a considerable sum in the divorce settlement. Her adult children are concerned that she     has a pattern of selling her homes and moving, as she believes that the neighbours are spying on     her, calling her names and threatening her. Things remain settled for a while in each new house,     then she begins to believe the same thing is happening with her new neighbours. Other than buying     and selling four houses, at a considerable financial loss each time, she cares for herself well day to     day, and cares well for her dog. She has argued with her neighbours but has never harassed or     threatened them. She does not work, other than housework. Her children tell you that she has had     these ideas for at least 15 years, but they have not noticed any other unusual ideas or behaviour.     Her general health is good and she has a GP. Her children say they have talked to her various     neighbours and are certain that her allegations are not based in fact. They say they're worried that     she's bankrupting herself, and want her assessed. They seem genuinely concerned for her and not     interested in any inheritance.     Question 6.1 (2 marks)     State the most likely diagnosis and give your reasons, based on the information above.                                                                                              mark                                                                                    worth                                                                                              (circle)      Delusional disorder, persecutory type.

    Modified Essay Question 1     The information from the neurosurgical ward staff is that Billy is showing no signs of brain injury as     he managed to hammer the screwdriver in between his frontal lobes, doing minimal damage.     Surgery was only to check this and clean the area. They say he has been calm and cooperative.     His community team and GP are shocked and surprised by the self-injury, but say Billy had been     quite stressed and is generally impulsive, with poor judgement. He is managed via a long-term     community-based Compulsory Treatment Order (Mental Health Act).     You find that Billy's mother is away in Australia, and his girlfriend with whom he lives also has     schizophrenia. The community team advise you not to contact her, saying she tends to be very     labile emotionally and they will support her and gather any information they can.     You go to the neurosurgical ward to assess Billy. You find him in a 4-bedded room with no special     nursing watch. He is awake and his head is thickly bandaged. The screwdriver is lying on the     nightstand beside him.     Question 1.2   (9 marks )     Outline how you would approach this situation, including the patient assessment and any     immediate interventions.                                                                                               mark                                                                                     worth                                                                                               (circle)                                                                                                 0      Attitude: A.                                                                                 max. 2       1      Maintain a calm manner and try to engage Billy and develop rapport.                        2      Secure the environment:                                                                    0      Remove the screwdriver - with Billy's permission as it's his property, even if he          1 B.                                                                                 max. 2      says he won't repeat the self-harm.

    Modified Essay Question 1     Your assessment of Billy shows that he has very concrete thinking and a fatuous affect. He appears     to be of relatively low IQ as well. There are no signs of acute psychosis, and the community team     did not think he had been relapsing.      The SHO repeats the request that Billy be transferred to the psychiatric inpatient unit which is in the     same general hospital, saying "we've done our bit - all he needs now is the antibiotics we've     prescribed".     Question 1.4    (8 marks )     Outline the key factors you would weigh up and the steps you would take, regarding     transferring Billy to the psychiatric unit. Assume there would be enough beds to admit him if     need be.                                                                                                mark                                                                                     worth                                                                                               (circle)      Pros and cons for patient:      Determine whether it would be in his best interests to remain on the                        0      neurosurgical ward: A.                                                                                  max. 2       1      - any medical or surgical reasons to keep him there;                                        2      - vs any disadvantages to him remaining there, such as the staff being        anxious, and less able to appropriately manage a patient with schizophrenia.      Liaison and advocacy:      Determine whether the psychiatric unit can be persuaded to accept him this      soon post-surgery. This would require information, reassurance and advocacy,                0      via liaison with the senior/charge nurse and/or admissions manager (etc.)                   1 B.    The situation needs discussion with registrar's supervisor before a decision, max. 3       2      and with the responsible psychiatrist at the psychiatric unit.                              3      It would be helpful to have the neurosurgical nurse liaise directly with      psychiatric unit nursing staff, possibly with additional nursing liaison if there      were nursing staff on the C-L team.      Medico-legal status and Consent:      Need to determine what Billy's status should be: can he be managed      essentially "voluntarily" with the Community Treatment Order continuing in the      background ready for his discharge home, or does his status need changing to                0      formal inpatient status (the details of this will vary depending on local mental            1 C.   health act provisions)? This should also be discussed with supervisor and the max. 3        2      relevant psychiatric staff.                                                                 3      Unless his Mental Health Act status is altered, Billy needs to consent to the      plan if he is to be moved. Ideally he needs to be provided with information and      be part of the decision. If he were uncooperative and had higher-risk plans, his      Mental Health Act status would need review.      Pragmatics:                                                                                 0 D.

MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION                                      2 Modified Essay Question 2 (26 marks) You are working on a Community Mental Health Centre (CMHC). Danny is a 22 year old indigenous man who has been treated voluntarily for a first episode of psychosis. He presented to mental health services for the first time three months ago after acting bizarrely at his local church. Before this incident Danny had been smoking cannabis with his cousin. His grandmother (who raised him, with his grandfather) says that he had no previous mental health problems but had a difficult childhood as he was physically abused by his father, and his mother died from rheumatic fever when he was 12. The Crisis Team assessed him and considered him psychotic. He was commenced on olanzapine 10mg daily which appeared to reduce his symptoms, and referred to the CMHC team for follow up. Before your first scheduled meeting you are contacted urgently by phone, by Danny's grandfather. Danny has been at the church again threatening churchgoers, saying they were not following the 'true path'. He said he was hearing God's voice directing him. Since starting olanzapine he has been spending more time alone. His grandfather says that he was heard muttering to himself in his room and he has been praying more, and clutching a Bible. You get as much detail as you can from Danny's grandfather and from the psychiatric records. Question 2.1 (11 marks) Outline how you would now go about arranging to do an urgent home-based Risk Assessment with Danny, and the key issues you would want to address at this assessment.

MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION 4 Modified Essay Question 4: (24 marks) When on call one night, you are asked by the Emergency Department houseofficer to see Paul, a 45 year old university mathematics lecturer. Paul has no past psychiatric history but was brought to the hospital after police happened on him in a local cemetery, attempting to hang himself from a tree. He did no injury to himself as he was interrupted before completing the attempt. Paul tells you that he no longer wants to live since his wife and their two children were killed in a helicopter crash two months ago. The helicopter was piloted by his father-in-law, who also died in the accident. Paul was not with them - his wife and children were on holiday at his father-in-law's sheep station. Paul has no siblings or other close family. His parents are both dead, his mother when he was aged 11, of cancer, and his father a year ago from a heart attack. Paul now lives alone and says he has drifted away from his prior friends, and has no real supports. Paul appears sad but talks freely. He says that he has made a reasoned decision to end his life, as without his family "there's nothing to live for". He denies any anxiety symptoms and when asked if he feels depressed, says "of course: wouldn't you be? But I'm not crazy and I'm not sick, if that's what you mean." Question 4.1 (2 marks) Based on the information in the vignette, if Paul has a psychiatric diagnosis, what would the two main differentials be?                                                                                    mark                                                                           worth                                                                                   (circle)                                                                                      0 A     Adjustment disorder with depressed mood                             max. 1     1                                                                                      0 B     Major depressive episode                                            max. 1     1                                                 Up to a maximum of 2 marks total                                                                            Total: Note to Examiners: Please mark all boxes.                                                                                         18 <<<
Modified Essay Question 4 You assess Paul, who has low mood and hopelessness regarding the future, but few vegetative symptoms of depression. He has some initial insomnia and admits to his sleep being relatively unrefreshing: "I wake up in the morning and for a second it's OK, then it hits me again: they're gone". He is making himself eat and has not lost weight. In the three weeks he has resumed work as a lecturer and finds that he can concentrate and manage a day's work. He says that it helps a little, as a distraction, but "feels pretty pointless". He has not attempted theoretical mathematical work, but can cope with basic lectures. There are no symptoms of any other psychiatric disorder and he does not drink or use drugs. He has no religious beliefs. Paul is clear that he sees no point in continued existence, and intends to make another suicide attempt as soon as he can.

    Modified Essay Question 5     No physical or neurological cause is found for Harry's behavioural change.

     MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION                                      6      Modified Essay Question 6: (18 marks)      Mr Klaus Larsen, a 44 year old man receiving a sickness benefit, has been referred to you at a Community Mental Health      Service by his new General Practitioner (GP). Mr Larsen has a history of recurrent major depression, having had three      episodes since age 35. He has moved to the city from a smaller rural community where he used to be a dairy farmer until      becoming too depressed to maintain the farm. He and his wife have relocated to a nearby suburb and she has found work      in an accountant's office. They are hopeful, the GP's letter says, that the greater resources available in the city will help      Mr Larsen more with his depression.      He has been depressed for nine months now, treated with paroxetine 60mgs mane, this having been increased from      20mgs to 40mgs then 60mgs mane across a three month period due to poor response.      Although he improved to a degree on this medication, such that appetite and sleep are somewhat better, he remains low      in energy, with poor concentration and motivation, anxious and pessimistic ruminations and mild diurnal variation, being      slower and more preoccupied in the mornings.      He has had two prior episodes - the first at age 30 followed a change in governmental agricultural policy which came      close to bankrupting him due to loss of subsidies, and was then treated with a four month course of amitriptyline to which      he responded but recalls severe sedation and dizziness. This was followed by another recurrence of depression at age 39      when the district was threatened with a foot and mouth scare and there was talk of slaughtering animals as a precaution.      On this second occasion his GP prescribed 20 mgs paroxetine and he responded to this across two months, remaining on      it for four years as he feared a recurrence. He then tapered and ceased it due to sexual side effects.      He has had no other form of treatment across the years, apart from short courses of hypnotics when the depressions      were severe.      Question 6.1      (6 marks )      In assessing Mr Larsen's recurrent and hard to treat depression, outline which aspects of      history review your assessment would include.                                                                                                                  mark                                                                                                      worth                                                                                                                  (circle)                                                                                                                     0       Detailed psychiatric, medical and personal history from Mr Larsen including his                               1 A     medication history & adherence, insight and any underlying psychological or                    max. 3         2       personality factors that might be perpetuating his depression.                                                3                                                                                                                     0 B     History to review his Risk Assessment.                                                         max. 1         1       Review his alcohol & drug use history, especially the amount of alcohol used,                                 0 C                                                                                                    max. 1       and any sequelae.                                                                                             1       Collateral history:                                                                                           0       .

Make sure you do read the exams section of the College website to be clear about how the real thing is in fact marked. E.g. 1/2 marks are not allowed in the real writtens, so examiners are forced to stick more strictly to the marking templates with less room for "fudging". In the real exams all questions are as evidence-based as possible, and we tried to manage this where we could, but some questions are less EBM-rigorous and are based more on extensive clinical experience. You will not agree with all the model answers, but then that very likely parallels the real writtens as well.                                                                                1 <<<

KEY FEATURE CASES Case 3           (6 marks) Joseph, aged 39, presents for the assessment of low mood. Routine questioning reveals that he has a strong compulsion to drink alcohol; routinely drinks larger amounts of alcohol than he intended; and that he has been unable to cut down this consumption. Joseph further reports that he spends a considerable amount of time drinking and recovering from drinking, to the extent that he has had to cut back on his work hours. Question 1 In your assessment of Joseph, what are other KEY areas to address when considering a diagnosis of alcohol dependence? List UP TO THREE. (4 marks) SCORING KEY A. Symptoms of tolerance. B. Symptoms of withdrawal. C. Continued use of alcohol despite clear evidence of harmful consequences.    Algorithm                                       Scoring Key    A = 1                                            1 mark for ONE of the three answers    B = 1                                           2 marks for TWO of the three answers    C = 1 mark                                      4 marks for ALL THREE answers    A + B = 2 marks                                 0 marks for MORE THAN THREE answers    A + C = 2 marks    B + C = 2 marks    A + B + C = 4 marks    More than 3 answers = 0 marks. Explanatory notes to marker: This question tests the candidates knowledge of the diagnosis of alcohol dependence as conceptualized by DSM- IVR and ICD 10 both of which are based on the theories of Edwards and Gross (all in Schuckit and Kaplan and Saddock). The history gives the other criteria for the diagnosis. DSM-IV-R has seven major criteria to look for in the history. Joesph's history gives criteria 3-6, so 1, 2 and 7 (tolerance, withdrawal, and continued use despite being aware of the problems it causes) are what is being looked for. ICD-10 has six major criteria, which are the DSMIV criteria grouped together plus craving or a sense of compulsion. Joseph's history is missing criteria 3,4, and 6 (tolerance, withdrawal, and continued use despite being aware of the problems it causes). If tolerance and withdrawal are grouped together as one item (indicating physiological dependence) this was marked as being correct for two points The most common mistake was including features of alcohol abuse or the CAGE questionnaire. Question 2 Joseph asks if his drinking might have caused his depression. What is THE KEY area in the history to explore when trying to distinguish an independent depression from a depression secondary to alcohol use? Write ONE answer only. ( 2 marks ) SCORING KEY     A. The key area in the history is establishing the temporal link between alcohol use and depression. If         the depression is only seen while drinking and remits in abstinence it is probably secondary. If it         preceded the commencement of the alcohol problems and is unaffected by abstinence then it is         probably independent.    Algorithm                                       Original Scoring Key                                                     1 mark for the temporal link                                                     1/2 mark for each elaboration of this link as noted above Explanatory note to marker: Schuckit, Kaplan and Saddock, and DSM IV all emphasize the temporal link, rather than specific symptoms, the dose of alcohol, or risk factors for either disease as being the key way to differentiate. DSM IV further specifies the length of abstinence (four weeks). Candidates almost universally identified this link, but did not elaborate both elements of this: which came first and whether the depression remitted in abstinence.                                                                                                                 18 <<<

KEY FEATURE CASES  Case 7           (6 marks) On starting work at a new community team, you pick up the care of Sheree, a 29 year old woman. Her file states that she has an eight-year history of schizoaffective disorder, with six past admissions. She has a history of extensive sexual and emotional abuse in childhood. Her main symptoms are persistent low mood, suicidal ideation, insomnia, cutting of the forearms, overvalued ideas of a persecutory nature which have during her admissions been of delusional intensity, and intractable derogatory auditory hallucinations. She has never had manic symptoms. She is treated with IM fluphenazine decanoate 50mgs monthly, oral olanzapine  20 mgs daily, clonazepam 0.5 mgs QID, lithium carbonate 1000 mgs nocte and fluoxetine 60 mgs mane. After reading the file, you have doubts about her diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder.  Question 1 What is the most likely alternative explanation for Sheree's longstanding symptoms, if she does not in fact have a schizoaffective disorder? (3 marks)  The answer needs to convey three key issues for the 3 marks:     1. The abuse has led to features of Borderline Personality Disorder / or accept Chronic PTSD    2. The abuse has also led to affective instability and lowered moods / dysthymia / depressive episodes    3. The apparent psychotic Sx are more likely to be dissociative in origin and also linked to the abuse (many canddiates interpreted the request for an "alternative explanation" too concretely and just gave  a diffferential Dx, with no explanatory linkage to the serious abuse history. )  You decide to review Sheree's diagnosis and reorganise her treatment. Question 2 Which would be the most important next steps for you to carry out? Select THREE OPTIONS ONLY from the list below.       (3 marks)   A. Tell her case manager about your rediagnosis and plans to alter Sheree's medication   B. Construct a detailed record of her treatment, using timelines to record medications   C. Chart a withdrawal regime for the clonazepam   D. Refer Sheree for sexual abuse therapy  E. Meet with Sheree, assess her and start to establish a therapeutic relationship  F. Rewrite Sheree's Crisis Management plan   G. Cease the IM fluphenazine and allow it to self-taper  H. Arrange a case conference of all the health professionals involved in Sheree's care   I. Present your reformulation and plan to the multidisciplinary team at the next meeting   J. Titrate down and then cease the lithium carbonate across a 4-week period Notes:  Correct answers are B, E and H  Essential to begin to establish a therapeutic relationship and to actually assess her before doing anything else, useful to summarize the past polypharmacy in detail, and a case conference is also useful. A - no, need to assess her first, C - no, not before seing her and reviewing the case more thoroughly, also is too high-handed. D - too precipitate and might be harmful, F - too high-handed - such plans need to be written in consultation with all involved. G - Ceasing IMI depot too high- handed prior to assessing her. I - Telling MDT your views also too high-handed, need a conference  first, not to dictate plan to others at this early stage. J - also too precipitate and would need more time for all involved to agree to this.                                                                                                     22 <<<

SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS Short Answer 14 (4 marks) You decide to embark on a course of cognitive therapy with a patient recovering from depression. Question 1 List in note form Beck's Cognitive Triad. (1 1/2 marks)         ·    Negative view of the self         ·    Negative view of the environment / world         ·    Negative view of the future       1/2 mark for each point Question 2 List in note form five of the 11 common cognitive distortions described by Beck. (2 1/2 marks)        1. ALL-OR-NOTHING THINKING: You see things in black-and-white categories.       2. OVERGENERALIZATION: You see a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.       3. MENTAL FILTER: You pick out a negative detail and dwell on it exclusively. Also = "tunnel vision".       4. DISQUALIFYING THE POSITIVE: You reject positive                  by insisting they "don' t count" for       some reason or other. In this way you can maintain a negative belief that is contradicted by your       everyday experiences.       5. JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS: You make a negative interpretation though there are no definite facts       that convincingly support conclusion.       a. Mind reading: You arbitrarily conclude that someone is reacting negatively to you and you don' t bother       to check this out.       b. The Fortune Teller Error: You anticipate that things will turn out badly, and you feel convinced that       your prediction is an already-established fact.       6. MAGNIFICATION (CATASTROPHIZING) OR MINIMIZATION: You exaggerate the importance of       things (such as your goof-up or someone else' s achievement), or you inappropriately shrink things until       they appear tiny (your own desirable qualities or the other fellow' s imperfections). This is also called the       ' binocular trick'        7. EMOTIONAL REASONING: You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way       things really are: ' I feel it, therefore it must be true.'        8. SHOULD STATEMENTS: You try to motivate yourself with shoulds and shouldn' ts, as if you had to be       whipped and punished before you could be expected to do anything. ' Musts' and ' oughts' are also       offenders. The emotional consequence is guilt. When you direct should statements toward others, you       feel anger, frustration and resentment.        9. LABELING AND MISLABELING: This is an extreme form of overgeneralization. Instead of describing       your error, you attach a negative label to yourself: ' I'm a loser.' When someone else's behavior rubs y       the wrong way, you attach a negative label to him: ' He' s a goddamn louse.' Mislabeling involves       describing an event with language that is highly colored and emotionally loaded.        10. PERSONALIZATION: You see yourself as the cause of some negative external event which in fact       you were not primarily responsible for.        11. SELF-WORTH: You make an arbitrary decision that in order to accept yourself as worthy, okay, or to       simply, feel good about yourself, you have to perform in a certain way; usually most or all of the time.       1/2 mark for each point given, to a max. of 2.5 marks                                                                                                         38 <<<

KEY FEATURE CASES Case 5          (6 marks) You are a consultation-liaison registrar working with an organ transplantation team. You assess Bruce, a 49 year old ex-army major with a history of alcohol dependence who has been ' dry' for 8 months. He has liver failure due to cirrhosis and needs a transplant. The transplant team ask you to assess his suitability and likelihood of remaining abstinent from alcohol post transplant. Bruce is in a stable marriage and his wife is supportive of him attending AA regularly. Bruce says that he now goes to church regularly instead of going to the pub, and is proud that he is "a reformed character". He has a past history of delirium tremens with hallucinations but no other past psychiatric history. Bruce has recently become mildly depressed at the prospect of a long wait for a donor, and has been tearful at times, but he denies any thoughts of suicide and still has some hope for the future. Question 1     (1 mark) Are there any ABSOLUTE CONTRAINDICATIONS to transplantation in Bruce' s case, from the details in the vignette above? Give ONE answer only. Scoring Key: Answer: No (1 mark if correct) Alcoholism as cause of liver failure is not a contraindication (quite common in transplant patients). Past DTs and current depression are not contraindications - the depression is recent, mild, and should be treatable. Only acute suicidality or refractory major psychiatric illness is a contraindication (and the latter only a relative one re Human Rights issues). Question 2     (5 marks) Which KEY FEATURES about Bruce in the vignette as above were identified by Vaillant as likely predictors of future abstinence? Give up to FOUR answers: Scoring Key: Vaillant's key features indicating future abstinence are:    A. Presence of adverse and consistent consequences to drinking (terminal illness, i.e. liver       failure)    B. Person has developed a substitute activity (church and/or AA)    C. Person has a relationship with someone committed to their welfare and rehabilitation (wife       supports AA)    D. Abstinence is a source of improved self-esteem or hope (pride re being "reformed") Scoring guide: 1 mark for each of A, B, C and D All 4 points are conveyed = 5 marks More than 4 answers = 0 NB: the main point of each factor as above needs to be conveyed.

KEY FEATURE CASES Case 6           (6 marks) Julia is a 42 year old woman who has been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder type 2. She lives alone and has no immediate family other than an elderly aunt living in the United Kingdom. Julia works as an office manager and can no longer afford to see her private psychiatrist so has been referred to the public system and this is the first time that you have seen her. For the last three months she has experienced symptoms of depression with melancholic features but with no psychosis. She was commenced on venlafaxine XR six weeks ago by her private psychiatrist and is currently on 300 mgs daily. Julia has no obvious side effects from the venlafaxine but she says that it has not helped and that her depression is worse, and she is insistent that it be ceased. She is taking no other medication and has no significant past medical history. As an initial step you agree to cease venlafaxine and to commence an alternative medication. Question 1    (4 marks) With reference to the available evidence-base, WHICH MEDICATION would you consider instituting for Julia instead of venlafaxine at the first consultation, before obtaining the results of any additional investigations?

Before you can consider any treatment change and while you are waiting for a cardiology assessment, a cardiac ECHO and her previous notes, Julia' s mental state deteriorates.She becomes increasingly hopeless, desperate and suicidal. She cannot keep herself safe and her arms are covered in self-inflicted bruising.

He has lived at home with his parents and has been quietly deluded and thought disordered, with poor functioning. He cannot work, does not drive and spends his time filling notebooks with chemistry pseudo-formulae and deluded scribblings. Martin and his parents refused to consider clozapine due to fears about its potential side-effects, but they have finally agreed, and he is admitted for a clozapine trial. He does very well on clozapine and in 5 weeks is free of psychosis for the first time in 12 years. His parents are delighted but Martin confides to you that he feels that 12 years of his life have been stolen away and that he deeply regrets not having tried clozapine much sooner. Question 1      (2 marks) Other than physical adverse effects, explain the MAIN RISK that you must now watch out for and manage, in Martin's case.

 KEY FEATURE CASES  Case 1           (6 marks)  John, a 43 year old single indigenous man, was admitted one week ago to the inpatient unit  under the Mental Health Act with a relapse of a pre-existing schizophrenic illness. He had been  under the care of a community team but was avoiding appointments and defaulting on treatment  as he had no insight into his illness. Recently he had stayed with a friend, but he has no fixed  address at present.  He appeals against being held under compulsory treatment and a legal review is arranged. At  this review his compulsory treatment in hospital is argued for by his psychiatrist on the basis that the disorganisation associated with John's illness renders him seriously incapable of self care.  John argues (with the help of a lawyer) that he chooses to live a semi-itinerant lifestyle, and that  although his standards are fairly basic, he is not so impaired that compulsory treatment is justified. The judge agrees, and discharges John from compulsory treatment.  Immediately after the hearing, John's distressed father and sister who attended the legal review  and were very unhappy about the outcome, reveal that they are frightened because last night  when they visited, John made a direct threat to kill his mother if she kept sexually assaulting him  at night. They say that they were too afraid of John to tell the judge about this during the hearing.  Question 1 (3 marks)  After the hearing John is demanding that the staff open the door so he can be released from the  unit. His lawyer is supporting his request.  What are the MOST URGENT steps to take at this point. Give UP TO THREE answers.  Answer:     A. Prevent John from leaving the unit     B.

SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS Short Answer 4           (5 marks) Question 1 (5 marks) List in note form the factors delineated by Hill that can indicate causation, in epidemiological studies.  1.   Temporal Relationship:  Exposure always precedes the outcome.  2.   Strength:  The stronger the association, the more likely it is that the relation of "A" to "B" is causal.  3.    Dose-Response Relationship:  An increasing amount of exposure increases the risk. If a dose-response relationship is  present, it is strong evidence for a causal relationship.  4.   Consistency:  The association is consistent when results are replicated in studies in different settings using  different methods.  5.    Plausibility:  The association agrees with currently accepted understanding of pathological processes.  6.    Consideration of Alternate Explanations:  In judging whether a reported association is causal, it is necessary to determine the extent to  which researchers have taken other possible explanations into account and have effectively  ruled out such alternate explanations.  7.   Experiment:  The condition can be altered (prevented or ameliorated) by an appropriate experimental  regimen.  8.   Specificity:  This is established when a single putative cause produces a specific effect. This is considered  by some to be the weakest of all the criteria.  9.   Coherence  The association should be compatible with existing theory and knowledge. In other words, it is  necessary to evaluate claims of causality within the context of the current state of knowledge  within a given field and in related fields. But - remember about "Paradigm Shifts".                                                                                      27 <<<

                 Critical Analysis Question 1                (20 marks) Read the abstract and answer the questions that follow. Age at onset and cognition in schizophrenia: meta-analysis T. K. Rajji, MD, FRCPC, Z. Ismail, MD, FRCPC and B. H. Mulsant, MD, MS, FRCPC Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto and Geriatric Mental Health Program, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Canada The British Journal of Psychiatry (2009) 195: 286-293. doi: 10.1192/bjp.bp. 108.060723 Background The relationship between cognition and age at onset of schizophrenia is largely unknown. Aims To compare cognitive deficits in individuals with youth-onset and late-onset schizophrenia with those in adults with first-episode schizophrenia. Method Twenty-nine databases (including EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO) were searched from 1980 to 2008. Selected publications had to include healthy controls and analyse separately individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or a related disorder and individuals with first-episode, youth-onset (maximum age of onset of 19 years) or late-onset schizophrenia (minimum age of onset of 40 years). Results Individuals with youth-onset and first-episode schizophrenia demonstrate large deficits (mean effect size ≥0.8) on almost all cognitive measures. Individuals with youth-onset schizophrenia demonstrate larger deficits than those with first-episode schizophrenia on arithmetic, executive function, IQ, psychomotor speed of processing and verbal memory. In contrast, those with late- onset schizophrenia demonstrate minimal deficits on arithmetic, digit symbol coding and vocabulary, but larger ones on attention, fluency, global cognition, IQ and visuospatial construction. Conclusions Individuals with youth-onset schizophrenia have severe cognitive deficits, whereas those with late-onset schizophrenia have some relatively preserved cognitive functions. This finding supports the view that severity of the disease process is associated with different ages at onset. In addition, the cognitive pattern of people with late-onset schizophrenia suggests that their deficits are specific rather than solely as a result of ageing and related factors.                                                                                            35 <<<

Younger age of onset is associated with a more marked phenotypic expression of      schizophrenia                                                          concurrent substance abuse, D.   Individuals with younger age of onset have higher rates of      worsening cognitive deficits E.

 Critical Analysis Question 2               (20 marks)  Read the abstract and answer the questions that follow.  Structured risk assessment and violence in acute psychiatric  wards: randomised controlled trial  Christoph Abderhalden, PhD, MNSc Nursing and Social Education Research Unit, University of Bern Psychiatric Services, Berne, Switzerland  The British Journal of Psychiatry (2008) 193: 44-50. doi: 10.1192/bjp.bp. 107.045534  Background  There is a lack of research on the possible contribution of a structured risk assessment to the reduction of aggression in psychiatric in-patient care.  Aims  To assess whether such risk assessments decrease the incidence of violence and coercion.  Method  A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted with 9 acute psychiatric admission wards as  the units of randomisation, (with four wards in the intervention arm and five wards in the control  arm). The intervention comprised a standardised risk assessment following admission with mandatory evaluation of prevention in high-risk patients.  Results Incidence rates decreased substantially in the intervention wards, whereas little change occurred in  the control wards. The adjusted risk ratios suggest a 45% reduction in severe aggressive incidents  and a 27% decline in the use of coercive measures. The severity of aggressive incidents did not  decrease.  Conclusions  Structured risk assessment during the first days of treatment may contribute to reduced violence  and coercion in acute psychiatric wards.                                                                                           39 <<<

Groups of subjects, as opposed to individual subjects, are randomised in the trial       They are randomised controlled trials with individuals, where the data is analysed in clusters E.       and presented as a "cluster graph"       Cluster randomised trials can inflate "false positive" errors (compared to standard F.       randomised controlled trials)       Statistical analysis of cluster randomised controlled trials occurs at the cluster level, and G.       cannot include patient level analysis of data       Cluster randomised trials involve greater complexity in the design and analysis (compared H.      to standard randomised control trials)       Cluster randomised trials can inflate "false negative" errors (compared to standard I.       randomised controlled trials)       A cluster randomised trial requires fewer subjects to achieve the same statistical Power  J.       than does an individually randomised control trial K.    Place-randomised trials is another term for cluster randomised trials       Cluster randomised trials can inflate Type II errors (compared to standard randomised L.       controlled trials) M.

Chen, Zhi Hu, Li Wei, Xia Qin, C. McCracken and J. R. Copeland Background Depression and dementia often exist concurrently. The associations of depressive syndromes and severity of depression with incident dementia have been little studied. Aims To determine the effects of depressive syndromes and cases of depression on the risk of incident dementia. Method Participants in China and the UK aged >65 years without dementia were interviewed using the Geriatric Mental State interview and re-interviewed 1 year later in 1254 Chinese, and 2 and 4 years later in 3341 and 2157 British participants respectively (Ageing in Liverpool Project Health Aspects: part of the Medical Research Council - Cognitive Function and Ageing study). Results Incident dementia was associated with only the most severe depressive syndromes in both Chinese and British participants. The risk of dementia increased, not in the less severe cases of depression but in the most severe cases. The multiple adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=5.44 (95% CI 1.67-17.8) for Chinese participants at 1-year follow-up, and HR=2.47 (95% CI 1.25-4.89) and HR=2.62 (95% CI 1.18-5.80) for British participants at 2- and 4-year follow-up respectively. The effect was greater in younger participants. Conclusions Only the most severe syndromes and cases of depression are a risk factor for dementia. [Excerpt from Methods: Assessment] A computer program assisted diagnosis - the Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy (AGECAT) - was used to analyse the information from the GMS to identify the principal mental disorders in participants. It was developed using a theoretical model and tested against its success at replicating diagnoses on samples diagnosed by psychiatrists. It attempts to replicate the process by which a psychiatrist achieves a syndromal diagnosis followed by a differential diagnosis. ... Individual participants are allocated to levels of confidence of diagnosis (0-5) on each of the eight diagnostic syndromes: organic disorder, depression, mania, schizophrenia and paranoid, obsessional, phobic, hypochondriacal, and general anxiety. ... the various syndrome levels are compared to derive a final differential diagnosis, a level of confidence of diagnosis from 0-5. A level of >3 in most circumstances designates a 'case level' that has been shown to correspond with what psychiatrists usually recognise as a case for intervention. Levels 1 and 2 are designated as 'sub-cases', and level 0 (no confidence level on any syndrome) is classified as 'well'. ... The AGECAT also divides depression into psychotic and neurotic types that appear to equate well with DSM-III/DSM-IV major depression, and dysthymia without the 2-year rule. Although the levels are intended to be levels of confidence of diagnosis, it has been our observation that, in those conditions where diagnosis tends to be on a continuum with normality, for example in cognitive decline and depression, the different levels tend also to reflect levels of severity in terms of type and numbers of symptoms.                                                                                        33 <<<

Am. J. Psych. 2009; 166:875-881. Objective: While several studies have shown that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an efficacious treatment for generalized anxiety disorder, few studies have addressed the outcome of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy, even though this treatment is widely used. The aim of this study was to compare short-term psychodynamic psycho- therapy and CBT with regard to treatment outcome in generalized anxiety disorder. Method: Patients with generalized anxiety disorder according to DSM-IV were randomly assigned to receive either CBT (N=29) or short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (N=28). Treatments were carried out according to treatment manuals and included up to 30 weekly sessions. The primary outcome measure was the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, which was applied by trained raters blind to the treatment conditions. Assessments were carried out at the completion of treatment and 6 months afterward. Results: Both CBT and short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy yielded significant, large, and stable improvements with regard to symptoms of anxiety and depression. No significant differences in outcome were found between treatments in regard to the primary outcome measure. These results were corroborated by two self-report measures of anxiety. In measures of trait anxiety, worry, and depression, however, CBT was found to be superior. Conclusions: The results suggest that CBT and short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy are beneficial for patients with generalized anxiety disorder. In future research, large-scale multicenter studies should examine more subtle differences between treatments, including differences in the patients who benefit most from each form of therapy. [Excerpt from Methods] This study was carried out in the Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy at the Georg-August-University Goettingen between May 2001 and June 2007. It was approved by the ethics committee of the university's school of medicine. After providing their informed consent, the patients were randomly allocated to the two treatment groups. An investigator allegiance effect was controlled for by including representatives of both short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (F. Leichsenring, S.S.) and CBT (E.L., C.W.) in the trial. The inclusion criteria required subjects to be between 18 and 65 years old and to have a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder. Primary diagnosis was defined as the most severe mental disorder according to the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule -Revised. The following exclusion criteria were applied: 1) any acute, unstable, or severe axis III medical disorder that might interfere with the successful completion of treatment, 2) any current or past history of schizophrenic disorder, bipolar disorder, or cluster A or B axis Il disorder, 3) any current or past neurological disorder, 4) alcohol or substance dependence or abuse, an eating disorder, or major depression in the previous 12 months, and 5) current concomitant psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological treatment.                                                                                         37 <<<

Both CBT and short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy included up to 30 (50- minute) sessions and were carried out according to treatment manuals ..... Implementation of the treatment manuals, including adherence to the manuals and competent delivery of the interventions, was ensured for each group of therapists by continuous group supervision, which was carried out every month by supervisors (F. Leichsenring, E.L.) who were highly experienced in CBT or psychodynamic therapy and highly familiar with the respective treatment manual. The supervision included reading and discussing the manual and talking over audiotaped cases or special treatment situations. All of the sessions were audiotaped. From each treatment included, one session was randomly selected and rated by nine independent raters who were provided with extensive information about the two treatment manuals, including their specific treatment elements. Each of the selected sessions was rated blindly by three to eight raters (including U.J., H.K., F. Leweke) with regard to the type of treatment that was applied. The raters identified 26 (89.7%) of 29 CBT sessions correctly as the form of therapy described in the CBT manual and 24 (85.7%) of 28 short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy sessions correctly as the form of therapy described in the short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy manual (overall rate of correct identification, 87.7%). A closer look at the misidentified treatment sessions showed that in these sessions, therapists of both types encouraged the patients to approach feared situations. As previously described, both approaches address feared situations, but they use different rationales. The kappa value for agreement beyond chance was 0.76, ... indicating excellent agreement beyond chance. Question 2.7 Select THREE correct statements, from the list below: (3 marks) (Please select ONLY three options: more than three answers will incur a mark of zero) A.    Kappa coefficient statistics suppose that, when not completely certain, raters simply guess. B.    The kappa coefficient measures test-retest reliability. C.    Kappas are reliably comparable across different studies, procedures, or populations. D.    Kappa statistics are not influenced by trait prevalence (distribution) or base-rates.       Kappa statistics are appropriate for testing whether agreement exceeds chance levels for E.       binary and nominal ratings.       Fleiss's guideline characterizing kappas over 0.75 as excellent, 0.40 to 0.75 as fair to good, F.       and below 0.40 as poor is entirely arbitrary. G.

It is difficult to generalise from this study to normal clinical settings, due to the need for very       experienced therapists prepared to work from a treatment manual. C.    The study's methods would be difficult to implement in normal clinical settings, due to the       need for regular group supervision by very experienced supervisors.                                               differences in outcome between treatments in D.    The study's inability to show significant      regard to the primary outcome is likely to be a Type I error.       It is difficult to generalise from this study, as Generalised Anxiety Disorder is a condition E.       which commonly presents in Primary Care where these therapy resources are not available. F.

    Modified Essay Question 1     The blood and urine tests you order all turn out to be unremarkable. Physical observations are     within normal limits. When you arrive at the rest home, nursing staff tell you that John is continuing     to hallucinate. His overnight sleep has been poor. John is not in pain. Constipation noted after his     arrival at the rest home was successfully treated with laxatives.     On mental state examination, John presents as mildly suspicious. He reports clearly seeing     "intruders" and animals in his bedroom. There is no auditory component associated with these     images. John reports feeling distressed and annoyed by these "intruders", but doesn't think the     "intruders" or anyone else will harm him. He reports feeling "on edge", and objectively looks     anxious. He denies feeling sad, depressed or suicidal.     A Montreal Cognitive Assessment you administer scores 22/30, with marks lost for delayed recall     (-4), visuospatial function (-3), and orientation (-1). His attention and concentration are good. You     notice he has a bilateral hand tremor.     On physical examination there is mild cogwheeling in both upper limbs, but no other abnormality.     He wears an old pair of eyeglasses.     Question 1.3   (4 marks)     Give your preferred diagnosis, plus the most likely differentials.

    MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION 4      Modified Essay Question 4: (22 marks)      You work on a Child and Family Mental Health team and are asked to see Gina, a 14 year old girl     who is in a paediatric ward after being admitted two days ago from school via ambulance. She     became dizzy at school and collapsed. There has been concern about how thin and sad she has     become over the past three months and the school counsellor called her mother recently to say she     thought she may have an eating disorder, after Gina was seen throwing out her lunches. It is     reported that her mother told the counsellor that Gina had a thin build "like the rest of the family" and     that she was being seen by her GP, who wasn't worried about her.      The paediatric ward reports that she is significantly underweight (height 90th percentile, weight less     than 3rd percentile), and her blood pressure, pulse and temperature have all been low but are now     improved. Her white cell count is a little low, but other investigations to date-FBC, renal function,     liver function and electrolytes-are all normal. She has no significant past mental health or medical     history and is taking no medicines other than phosphate and vitamin supplements prescribed by the     ward.     Question 4.1 (4 marks)      Other than eating disorder, list the main differential diagnoses you would want to explore,     and give reasons why.                                                                                                 mark                                                                                      worth                                                                                                (circle)                                                                                                   0                                                                   include               2         1 A     Organic disorder leading to weight loss (causes are varied but      thyrotoxicosis, inflammatory bowel disease, infections and malignancies).                    2                                                                                                   0 B     Major depression - in view of sadness and weight loss.                            2         1                                                                                                   2                                     Up to a maximum of 4 marks in total              TOTAL:     Note to Examiners: Please mark all boxes.                                                                                                    18 <<<

A 24 year old man, Will, with a     diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, has been admitted under your care after being arrested for     manually assaulting his brother-in-law during an argument. At the time of his arrest he was found     with a knife in his possession. He is due to appear in court for this assault and other charges, in     seven days. Will has been under the care of your local mental health service for 6 months after     moving here from another area. He is treated with oral olanzapine. Will has a prior history of assault     about which you have limited information. On admission he appears drunk and refuses to engage in     interview.

    MODIFIED ESSAY QUESTION 6     Modified Essay Question 6: (15 marks)     You work on an adult Crisis Service and are asked to meet with the son and daughter of a woman     with no prior contact with mental health services, called Sophia. Sophia is a 53 year old woman who     lives by herself in her own home, with her German Shepherd dog. She was divorced at age 40 and     received a considerable sum in the divorce settlement. Her adult children are concerned that she     has a pattern of selling her homes and moving, as she believes that the neighbours are spying on     her, calling her names and threatening her. Things remain settled for a while in each new house,     then she begins to believe the same thing is happening with her new neighbours. Other than buying     and selling four houses, at a considerable financial loss each time, she cares for herself well day to     day, and cares well for her dog. She has argued with her neighbours but has never harassed or     threatened them. She does not work, other than housework. Her children tell you that she has had     these ideas for at least 15 years, but they have not noticed any other unusual ideas or behaviour.     Her general health is good and she has a GP. Her children say they have talked to her various     neighbours and are certain that her allegations are not based in fact. They say they're worried that     she's bankrupting herself, and want her assessed. They seem genuinely concerned for her and not     interested in any inheritance.     Question 6.1 (2 marks)     State the most likely diagnosis and give your reasons, based on the information above.                                                                                              mark                                                                                    worth                                                                                              (circle)      Delusional disorder, persecutory type.

Explain your reasons and mention any     medico-legal and ethical issues that are relevant.                                                                                            mark                                                                                  worth                                                                                            (circle)      Contact Sophia's GP:      Sophia has not refused permission for this, in fact she said you could "talk to         0 A    anyone" so this is not a breach of her privacy. Check her general health and max. 2     1      any treatment she might be on with the GP and ask if the GP is aware of her             2      beliefs, and has any concerns about her safety or that of others.      Contact Sophia's family again and arrange to meet to get more collateral:               0 B    Ensure you have gathered all relevant information to clarify her symptoms, the max. 2   1      history and the risk issues, and to try and rule out differentials.                     2      Explain the medico-legal issues to Sophia's family:      Sophia definitely sounds to have a psychotic disorder, but an involuntary      assessment can only be arranged if there are grounds for concern that she is a      significant risk to herself, impaired in her self-care, or a risk to others. Discuss      with family to try to determine if there are grounds to be concerned. In NZ, for        0 C    instance, there would need to be more grounds for concern than merely buying max. 2     1      and selling houses unwisely, at a financial loss. The ethical dilemma is                2      Sophia's right to autonomy vs the beneficent need to treat her if she is unwell      and at risk, and the need not to make the situation worse iatrogenically (non-      maleficence).      (Exact details may vary depending on local Mental Health Act law - markers      should take that into account)      Consider talking with Sophia's neighbours:      If there are grounds from what the family tell you at least to collect more      information, consider visiting her neighbours to gather additional collateral           0 D    regarding possible risk issues. Sophia did say "you can talk to anyone" but max. 2      1      given her beliefs, she is unlikely to feel comfortable about you talking with the       2      neighbours so the privacy concerns are more of an issue than they were when      talking with her GP-there would need to be definite grounds.                                           dilemmas and complexities in this           1      0 E    Candidates may mention discussing the                                       max.      case with the multidisciplinary team and/or in supervision.                             1                                   Up to a maximum of 7 marks in total            TOTAL:     Note to Examiners: Please mark all boxes, even if the total adds up to more than 7.     Final Mark is to be set at not more than 7.

    Modified Essay Question 6     Six months later, Sophia is acutely admitted for the first time, after an altercation with her elderly     neighbour during which she verbally threatened to "brain" him if he didn't stop persecuting her. She     is placed under a compulsory treatment order, treated with second generation antipsychotic     medication (orally and via depot), and discharged, after three weeks, for follow-up at the community     team where you work.     Her children are relieved that she is receiving treatment and follow-up, but a month after her     admission they say that she is again saying that she plans to sell her house and buy another one.     They ask you if her compulsory status means that they can now stop her from selling her house and     moving again.     Question 6.3   (6 marks)     What advice would you give them? Explain the issues involved.                                                                                               mark                                                                                     worth                                                                                              (circle)      Mental Health Act treatment versus Guardianship:      Modern Mental Health Acts do not generally cover longer-term guardianship-                 0 A    they cover issues around treatment and follow-up, but not control of a person's max. 2     1      property and of their life decisions.                                                      2      So Sophia being under the M.H. Act does not mean that her family can stop      her from selling her house.      Sophia may develop more insight and better judgement, or at least be more      prepared to take advice, once she is effectively treated. Better to postpone the           0 B    issue of the house until her degree of recovery can be ascertained. Explain to max. 2      1      her family how long the deport medication will take to reach a steady-state and            2      take full effect.      If she remains deluded such that her judgement regarding her property and life      decisions is still significantly impaired even after a reasonable period of      treatment, she will need a capacity assessment regarding her competence to                 0 C    manage her own property. There should be mention of Guardianship              max. 2       1      legislation. The least restrictive order possible should be obtained-i.e. it may           2      be that her family should only assist her with Property decisions, rather than      being granted full Welfare Guardianship.      Explain you will review Sophia as an out-patient. Clarify her reasons for      wanting to move and her mental state, and manage accordingly.                                                                                                 0 D    Sophia may want to move house due to the altercation with her neighbour-      max. 2       1      out of residual persecutory fears, or due to embarrassment about her outburst.             2      This needs to be assessed, and managed appropriately. A meeting with the      neighbour might be considered, if both parties would agree.                                     Up to a maximum of 6 marks in total            TOTAL:     Note to Examiners: Please mark all boxes, even if the total adds up to more than 6.     Final Mark is to be set at not more than 6.
