\f2 Modified Essay 1
\f0 \

\f2 Olivia is a 29-year-old, married mother of three children aged twelve months to eight years. She experienced
\f0 \

\f2 significant sexual abuse in her childhood. Olivia has just been discharged to the local community mental health team at which
\f0 \

\f2 you work, following a three-month admission to a nearby acute psychiatric inpatient unit.
\f0 \

\f2 Prior to admission Olivia became depressed after hearing that her brother had been found guilty of sexually assaulting his
\f0 \

\f2 stepdaughter. She developed flashbacks and nightmares of her own experiences of abuse, and had frequent panic attacks.
\f0 \

\f2 She was found by her oldest child with a cord around her neck, and admitted to hospital.
\f0 \

\f2 Her hospital admission was characterised by recurrent episodes of self-harm including lacerating her arms and tying cords
\f0 \

\f2 around her neck. She was treated with sodium valproate, paroxetine and diazepam. Olivia was eventually discharged on these
\f0 \

\f2 medications still symptomatic.
\f0 \

\f2 Question 1.1
\f0 \

\f2 Discuss the immediate and longer term psychiatric interventions you would suggests for Olivia's previous sexual abuse.
\f0 \

\f0 \

\f2 The primary focus should be on containment and symptom control (candidates may discuss strategies to achieve these
\f0 \

\f2 objectives in more detail).
\f0 \

\f2 It is inappropriate to do acute exploratory work while Olivia is acutely symptomatic (candidates may discuss in more depth the
\f0 \

\f2 adverse consequences of exploratory psychotherapy when a patient is unwell).

\f2 Maria, aged 25 years, has a history of epilepsy since early childhood with multiple seizure types, a poor response to anticonvul-
\f0 \

\f2 sants, and longstanding cognitive difficulties (her full-scale IQ is 65). She lives with her parents in a small country town, and
\f0 \

\f2 intermittently attends a supported work program packing boxes of fruit.
\f0 \

\f2 She was admitted in status epilepticus to a tertiary intensive care unit and was ventilated for 3 days. Two days ago, she was
\f0 \

\f2 transferred to the neurology ward. Since waking up she has been telling her parents that \'93everyone is spying on me with
\f0 \

\f2 satellite cameras,\'94 and that the nursing staff are saying horrible things about her. She is worried that the food is poisoned.

         Modified Essay 1 \
         Olivia is a 29-year-old, married mother of three children aged twelve months to eight years. She experienced \
         significant sexual abuse in her childhood. Olivia has just been discharged to the local community mental health team at which \
         you work, following a three-month admission to a nearby acute psychiatric inpatient unit. \
\
         Prior to admission Olivia became depressed after hearing that her brother had been found guilty of sexually assaulting his \
         stepdaughter. She developed flashbacks and nightmares of her own experiences of abuse, and had frequent panic attacks. \
         She was found by her oldest child with a cord around her neck, and admitted to hospital. \
\
         Her hospital admission was characterised by recurrent episodes of self-harm including lacerating her arms and tying cords \
         around her neck. She was treated with sodium valproate, paroxetine and diazepam. Olivia was eventually discharged on these \
         medications still symptomatic. \
\
         Question 1.1 \
         Discuss the immediate and longer term psychiatric interventions you would suggests for Olivia's previous sexual abuse. \
         Please give reasons for your choices. (7 marks) \
\
        A.     Focus of psychiatric interventions in immediate phase. \
               The primary focus should be on containment and symptom control (candidates may discuss strategies to achieve these                O            I \
               objectives in more detail).                                                                                                       1 \
               It is inappropriate to do acute exploratory work while Olivia is acutely symptomatic (candidates may discuss in more depth the     2 \
               adverse consequences of exploratory psychotherapy when a patient is unwell). \
        B.     Psycho-education and explanation of symptoms.                                                                                     O \
               Candidates may discuss the particular elements and strategies of their psycho-educational intervention.                           1 \
                                                                                                                                                 2 \
        C.     Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.                                                                                                    O \
               Simple CBT for panic or anxiety symptoms, for example, breathing, relaxation. \
               Some candidates may describe the focus and strategy of their CBT in more depth.                                                   2 \
        D.     Chain analysis.                                                                                                                   O \
               Candidates may discuss the use of chain analysis that focuses on the link between triggers of abuse reminders and self-harm. \
                                                                                                                                                  2 \
        E.     Longer term interventions.                                                                                                        O \
               When Olivia is in a stable state with respect to depression or PTSD and has stable supports, she may or may not choose to work    1 \
               psychotherapeutically on abuse issues.                                                                                            2 \
        F.     Other.                                                                                                                            0 \
               Any technique that increases her understanding of the links between abuse and her own emotional responses, and increases her      1 \

\
   Olivia has just found out that she is pregnant again as a result of having sex with her husband when on weekend leave from \
   hospital. She and her husband are concerned about the effects of her psychotropic medication on the baby. \
\
   Question 1.3 \
   Outline the information and options you would discuss with Olivia and her husband. Please provide adequate detail. \
   (10 marks) \
\
  A.     Attitudes to pregnancy                                                                                                                     O \
         Sensitively discuss attitudes to pregnancy, and provide support for options Olivia and husband wish to explore. This may                   1 \
         include termination or continuation of pregnancy, given her level of unwellness. If Olivia and her husband are wishing to look at           2 \
         termination, capacity to consent may need exploring. \
  B.     Risk-benefit analysis                                                                                                                      O \
         Discuss the risks and benefits of psychotropic medication during pregnancy, especially the risk of untreated serious mental                1 \
         illness. Review current medication in terms of whether it is needed, and stop unnecessary medications. Usually by time                      2 \
         pregnancy is confirmed, the maximum risk for malformation has passed (by 8 weeks of gestation). \
  C.     Antidepressants                                                                                                                           O \
         Paroxetine is generally safe in the 1st trimester (no reported increase in foetal malformations).                                          1 \
          There is a risk of withdrawal syndrome in infants associated with use of SSRI in the 3rd trimester. There may be a need to                 2 \
         reduce dose in latter stages. \
  D.      Benzodiazepines                                                                                                                           O \
          Benzodiazepines are associated with increased incidence of cleft palate in the 1st trimester, so try to avoid them.                       1 \
          Benzodiazepines are also associated with neonatal withdrawal and floppy infant when used in the 3rd trimester.                            2 \
  E.     Valproate                                                                                                                                  O \
         Sodium valproate is associated with increased fetal malformations in the 1st trimester including cardiac and oro-facial                    1 \
         malformations. It is associated low birth weight and head circumference. Avoid if possible, if not, use a lower dose.                      2 \
  F.      Breast feeding                                                                                                                            O \
         All drugs pass into breast-milk in varying amounts. One has to evaluate the risks and benefits. Paroxetine is regarded as one of           1 \
         the safer of the antidepressants in breastfeeding mothers.                                                                                 2 \
  G.     Obstetric liaison                                                                                                                          O \
         Stress need for close monitoring of mental state and liaison with obstetric service during pregnancy                                       1 \
                                                                                                                                                    2 \

\
           Maria, aged 25 years, has a history of epilepsy since early childhood with multiple seizure types, a poor response to anticonvul- \
           sants, and longstanding cognitive difficulties (her full-scale IQ is 65). She lives with her parents in a small country town, and \
           intermittently attends a supported work program packing boxes of fruit. \
\
           She was admitted in status epilepticus to a tertiary intensive care unit and was ventilated for 3 days. Two days ago, she was \
           transferred to the neurology ward. Since waking up she has been telling her parents that "everyone is spying on me with \
           satellite cameras," and that the nursing staff are saying horrible things about her. She is worried that the food is poisoned. \
\
           You are asked by the neurology team to see Maria. \
\
           Question 2.1 \
           Discuss the information you would seek prior to seeing Maria. Please give reasons for your answers. (12 marks) \

   The neurologist is happy for Maria to remain under her care as the risk of further seizures is quite high. However, the nursing \
   ward staff have now become anxious about managing Maria on the neurology ward because they feel she is "crazy" and may be \
   a danger to the other sick patients. \
\
   Question 2.3 \
   Describe how you would address the nursing staff's concerns. (7 marks) \
\
  A.     Liaison with neurology team: \
                                                                                                                                                    0 \
         For example, meet with neurologist and senior members of the nursing staff to seek consensus on place of management. \
                                                                                                                                                    1 \
         For example, offer to meet with nursing staff to explore their concerns, discuss management strategies and initiate \
                                                                                                                                                     2 \
         psycho-education. \
  B.     Practical advice and interventions at a ward level \
         For example, advise on strategies to enhance recovery (clear advice on how to respond to her delusional beliefs, including how             0 \
         to handle the problem that she thinks food is poisoned). \
                                                                                                                                                     1 \
         Also, for example, offer input from psychiatric nursing staff regarding nursing care management of patients with psychotic                 2 \
         symptoms \
         Finally, do not underestimate the importance of a clear management plan in the case notes. \
  C.     Ongoing review \
                                                                                                                                                    0 \
         For example, assessing risk to Maria and to other patients. \
                                                                                                                                                    1 \
         For example, visit ward regularly to review Maria, be available to nursing staff, be clear that if her psychosis increases beyond \
                                                                                                                                                    2 \
         the level that is safe you will rethink place of management. \
  D.     Family involvement                                                                                                                        O \
         For example, if family are able to contain Maria, encourage them to stay with her, bring or organise food etc. Candidates may              1 \
         address the issue of them coming from a small country town.                                                                                2 \
  E.     Medication advice                                                                                                                          O \
          This concerns the issue of medication, its prescription, how to use it, the role of prn medication and the use of antipsychotic           1 \
         medication.                                                                                                                                2 \
  F.      Spare (only to be used after approval has been sought from Chair, WSC).                                                                   1 \

           Lisa, aged 14 years, lives with her parents and younger sister. She is an excellent student in Year 10 and has until recently been \
           very involved in competitive gymnastics. \
\
           Lisa has been in a Paediatric ward for a week with a history of intermittent nausea and weight loss over several months. She \
           has had a full medical assessment including an abdominal ultrasound, a gastroscopy and various blood and faecal tests. \
\
           The paediatric gastroenterologist does not consider her symptoms to be due to any obvious pathological process and plans to \
           discharge her today with a six-week follow-up appointment. The nursing staff ask for referral to psychiatry because they have \
           noted that she avoids food and she has lost further weight while in hospital. They are concerned that she has an eating \
           disorder. \
\
           Lisa's parents reluctantly agree to you assessing her. \
\
           Question 3.1 \
           As part of your comprehensive psychiatric assessment, describe how you would assess Lisa's eating behaviour. \
           Do not cover the rest of the psychiatric assessment. (8 marks) \

   Modified Essay 3 \
   Following your assessment, you make a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa restrictive sub-type. There is no other co-morbid \
   psychiatric diagnosis. Lisa has a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 14.5. \
   You discuss the results of your assessment with Lisa and her parents and start arranging ongoing management. \
\
   Several hours later the gastroenterologist contacts you to say that Lisa must be transferred to a psychiatric ward because Lisa's \
   bed is needed for medical patients. A nurse takes you aside to tell you that Lisa has just told her that she will kill herself if she is \
   made to eat, but does not want her parents told about this. \

           You have recently assessed Mr Newbery, aged 84 years, who lives in a residential care centre for people with \
           dementia. Mr Newbery suffers from moderately severe Alzheimer's disease. \
\
           The staff are concerned that he is verbally aggressive towards staff and other residents, and occasionally lashes out and hits \
           staff. Some of the untrained staff in the centre feel that Mr Newbery is deliberately "playing up" and are annoyed with him. \
\
           When you examine Mr Newbery he is calm but severely cognitively impaired. He has no apparent physical problems. Recent \
           routine laboratory investigations including mid stream urine culture are unremarkable. Mr Newbery is on no medication. \
\
           Question 4.1 \
           Describe the information you would ask the residential care staff to collect regarding Mr Newbery's difficult behavior. \

\
            You are working as the junior consultant in a large general hospital. Tony, aged 23 years, was involved in a motorcycle accident in which he sustained \
            multiple internal injuries and an unstable neck fracture. Tony has surgery to stabilise his cervical spine and is currently immobilised in halo traction, \
            has a chest drain, and cannot be moved. \
\
            Two days after the surgery, the spinal injury team contacts you expressing concern at Tony's excessive demands for opiates. When you speak to Tony \
            he tells you that he is 'in agony' and can't sleep because of the pain in his back. He looks anxious and low in mood, but denies anxiety or depressive \
            symptoms. \
            Tony is demanding to smoke cigarettes and cannabis and says that he cannot cope with hospital without them. He has threatened to sign himself out \
            of hospital. He is verbally aggressive towards staff especially when they try to discuss the hospital smoke-free policy with him. The staff would like \
            your help in managing Tony. \

  The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
  You are working as the junior consultant in a large general hospital. Tony, aged 23 years, was involved in a motorcycle accident in which he sustained \
  multiple internal injuries and an unstable neck fracture. Tony has surgery to stabilise his cervical spine and is currently immobilised in halo traction, \
  has a chest drain, and cannot be moved. \
\
  Two days after the surgery, the spinal injury team contacts you expressing concern at Tony's excessive demands for opiates. When you speak to Tony \
  he tells you that he is 'in agony' and can't sleep because of the pain in his back. He looks anxious and low in mood, but denies anxiety or depressive \
  symptoms. \
\
  Tony is demanding to smoke cigarettes and cannabis and says that he cannot cope with hospital without them. He has threatened to sign himself out \
  of hospital. He is verbally aggressive towards staff especially when they try to discuss the hospital smoke-free policy with him. The staff would like \
  your help in managing Tony. \
\
  Your registrar says the diagnosis is Antisocial Personality Disorder. \
\
  Tony gives a history of heavy use of cigarettes (30 per day) and daily cannabis use (2-3 joints per day). \
\
  Question 4.2 \
  Discuss (list and debate) what strategies you would advise your registrar might use to help Tony manage without cigarettes and cannabis. \

   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   You are working as the junior consultant in a large general hospital. Tony, aged 23 years, was involved in a motorcycle accident in which he sustained \
   multiple internal injuries and an unstable neck fracture. Tony has surgery to stabilise his cervical spine and is currently immobilised in halo traction, \
   has a chest drain, and cannot be moved. \
\
   Two days after the surgery, the spinal injury team contacts you expressing concern at Tony's excessive demands for opiates. When you speak to Tony \
   he tells you that he is 'in agony' and can't sleep because of the pain in his back. He looks anxious and low in mood, but denies anxiety or depressive \
   symptoms. \
\
   Tony is demanding to smoke cigarettes and cannabis and says that he cannot cope with hospital without them. He has threatened to sign himself out \
   of hospital. He is verbally aggressive towards staff especially when they try to discuss the hospital smoke-free policy with him. The staff would like \
   your help in managing Tony. \
\
   Your registrar says the diagnosis is Antisocial Personality Disorder. \
\
   Tony gives a history of heavy use of cigarettes (30 per day) and daily cannabis use (2-3 joints per day). \

   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   You are the on-call psychiatrist to a public hospital and you are contacted by a psychiatry registrar. \
\
   Mark is a 45-year-old single successful car salesman who has presented to the Emergency Department expressing suicidal ideation with a plan and intent. \
   He had been recently charged with sexual assault after a work function. He has no previous psychiatric history. \
\
   The registrar informs you that, on examination, Mark is distressed and tearful. Mark is fearful of legal costs. He reports he cannot recall the incident on the \
   night and states that he was very intoxicated that night. Mark says he will kill himself if he is jailed. He has stated that he is too ashamed to discuss this \
   matter with his parents. \
\
   A bed is available but the registrar expresses uncertainty about whether or not to admit Mark to an inpatient unit. \
\
   Question 4.2 \
   Outline (list and justify) what in Mark's history and presentation would indicate that he needs admission. (6 marks) \

   Modified Essay 4 \
   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   You are the on-call psychiatrist to a public hospital and you are contacted by a psychiatry registrar. \
\
   Mark is a 45-year-old single successful car salesman who has presented to the Emergency Department expressing suicidal ideation with a plan and intent. \
   He had been recently charged with sexual assault after a work function. He has no previous psychiatric history. \
\
    The registrar informs you that, on examination, Mark is distressed and tearful. Mark is fearful of legal costs. He reports he cannot recall the incident on the \
   night and states that he was very intoxicated that night. Mark says he will kill himself if he is jailed. He has stated that he is too ashamed to discuss this \
   matter with his parents. \
\
   A bed is available but the registrar expresses uncertainty about whether or not to admit Mark to an inpatient unit. \
\
   A few weeks later, the registrar contacts you, advising that they have received a request from Mark's solicitor (with signed consent) asking for a report \
   regarding the assessment on the night of his presentation. Your service has a policy of responding to such requests. \
\
   Your registrar asks your advice on how to prepare such a report. \
\
   Question 4.3 \
   Describe (list and explain) your advice to the registrar. (6 marks) \
\
  A.       Teach/explain differences between treating doctor report/statement and forensic reports.                                                                 O \
                                                                                                                                                                     1 \
\
  B.       Review the RANZCP Statement on reports to the court.                                                                                                     O \
\
  C.       Providing a brief, factual summary of the presentation and management, including mental state on the night of his presentation.                          O \
           Avoid speculation about mental state at the time of the alleged offence and about any future risky behavior. \
                                                                                                                                                                     2 \
                                                                                                                                                                    3 \
\
  D.       Advise registrar that once they prepare the report they may want to run it by legal services.                                                            O \
                                                                                                                                                                     1 \
\
  E.       The registrar is to advise the solicitor they would need to get an independent assessment if they want an opinion about any forensic matters;            O \
          if other mental health clinicians were involved in the treatment (inpatient or community) the solicitor may want a treating doctor report from            1 \
           those involved.                                                                                                                                           2 \

            Each question within this modified essay question will be marked by a different examiner. The examiner marking one question will not have \
            access to your answers to the other two questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and specifically. \

            You are the consultant psychiatrist treating Paul, aged 51 years. He was admitted ten days ago to the acute psychiatric unit in which you work with a \
            diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features. He was commenced on fluoxetine 20mg daily one week prior to admission and \
            risperidone 3mg daily was added on admission. Paul's mental state had begun to improve and the level of nursing observation was reduced. \
\
            When you arrive at work early on Monday morning, you are told that Paul hanged himself in a ward bathroom during the weekend and that attempts to \
            resuscitate him had been unsuccessful. \
\

   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   You are the consultant psychiatrist treating Paul, aged 51 years. He was admitted ten days ago to the acute psychiatric unit in which you work with a \
   diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features. He was commenced on fluoxetine 20mg daily one week prior to admission and \
   risperidone 3mg daily was added on admission. Paul's mental state had begun to improve and the level of nursing observation was reduced. \
\
   When you arrive at work early on Monday morning, you are told that Paul hanged himself in a ward bathroom during the weekend and that attempts to \
   resuscitate him had been unsuccessful. \
\
   You receive a phone-call from Paul's ex-wife, Helen, who has been contacted by the police as next-of-kin and informed of his death. Helen wants to \
   know what she should say to her 12 year old son, Tim, as he does not yet know that his father has died. Helen wonders if she should avoid telling Tim \
   that the cause of death was suicide. Tim last saw his father two months ago when he stayed with him for the school holidays. \
\
   Question 1.2 \
   Outline (list and detail) the information and advice you would give to Helen to help with Tim. (6 marks) \
\
  A.      GENERAL PRINCIPLES                                                                                                                        O \
          Importance of honesty with children. Children cope better if given straight-forward information delivered in a developmentally            1 \
         appropriate fashion.                                                                                                                        2 \
  B.      GRIEF AND LOSS                                                                                                                            O \
         Likely reactions in the child given the child's temperament, the meaning of the loss of a father and his relationship with his father.     1 \
         Assist mother to understand that Tim is likely to have different thoughts and feelings about the death than what she will have.            2 \
         Advise that children will often think they are to blame. \
  C.      SPECIFIC EXPLANATION \
                                                                                                                                                    O \
                                                                                  did not love him and that there is no blame. \
          Explanation that the father was very ill. That it didn't mean that the father                                                             1 \
          Reassurance that the mother will be okay and that she is always available. The issue of attendance at the funeral depends upon the        2 \
         child's needs and wishes. \
\
  D.      POSSIBLE MEETING                                                                                                                          O \
         Discuss whether she would like to meet with you and the registrar.                                                                         1 \
  E.      ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS \
                                                                                                                                                    O \
         Discuss with the mother what additional supports may be available if required for her and for Tim. For example, other family \
                                                                                                                                                    1 \

\
   You are the consultant psychiatrist treating Paul, aged 51 years. He was admitted ten days ago to the acute psychiatric unit in which you work with a \
   diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features. He was commenced on fluoxetine 20mg daily one week prior to admission and \
   risperidone 3mg daily was added on admission. Paul's mental state had begun to improve and the level of nursing observation was reduced. \
\
   When you arrive at work early on Monday morning, you are told that Paul hanged himself in a ward bathroom during the weekend and that attempts to \
   resuscitate him had been unsuccessful. \
\
   You receive a phone-call from Paul's ex-wife, Helen, who has been contacted by the police as next-of-kin and informed of his death. Helen wants to \
   know what she should say to her 12 year old son, Tim, as he does not yet know that his father has died. Helen wonders if she should avoid telling Tim \
   that the cause of death was suicide. Tim last saw his father two months ago when he stayed with him for the school holidays. \
\
   Four days later, you notice that the nursing staff are keeping all of the patients on high levels of observation, and are reluctant to let any patients have \
   leave. The nurses are also complaining that there are not enough staff to provide adequate patient care. \
\
   Question 1.3 \
   Outline (list and justify) specific issues that may be contributing to these observations. (8 marks) \

           Modified Essay 3 \
           You are working as a registrar in the consultation liaison psychiatry service of a general hospital. You are contacted by the Resident \
           Medical Officer (RMO/PGY2/Senior House Officer) on a medical ward with the message that the medical service would like to transfer \
           a patient to the psychiatry service. Theo is a 25-year-old man who was admitted to the medical service three days ago after an \
           overdose involving multiple substances, not all of which are known. He is proving difficult to manage on the medical ward due to his \
           wandering, agitation, and occasional aggressive outbursts without physical violence. He does not make much sense when he talks and \
           the medical team feel he is clearly psychotic and should be transferred to the inpatient psychiatry team. \
\
           Question 3.1 \
           Outline your approach to managing this situation. \
           (6 marks) \
\
          A.     Preparation for task: Discuss the situation with the RMO to obtain as much clinical information as you can. Explain that you are O \
                 happy to assess the patient but that you cannot promise that they will be transferred to a psychiatric ward as this may not be the \
                 most appropriate course of action.                                                                                                2 \
          B.     Nature of interaction: The approach is respectful and involves an exchange of information.                                        O \
                                                                                                                                                   1 \
          C.     Extra Information: Action: Review the clinical notes and investigation results. Obtain clinical information from nursing staff and O \
                 available medical staff. Obtain collateral history from family, including psychiatric and medical history.                        1 \
                                                                                                                                                    2 \
\
          D.     Action: Go to the ward as soon as practicable. Examine the patient. Formulate an opinion and record it in the notes before or     O \
                 after discussion with supervisor (discussion with supervisor essential).                                                          1 \

  The information that is presented in italics in questions 2, 3 and 4 of each MEQ is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case \
  vignette. \
\
  You are working as a registrar in the consultation liaison psychiatry service of a general hospital. You are contacted by the Resident \
  Medical Officer (RMO/PGY2/Senior House Officer) on a medical ward with the message that the medical service would like to transfer \
  a patient to the psychiatry service. Theo is a 25-year-old man who was admitted to the medical service three days ago after an \
  overdose involving multiple substances, not all of which are known. He is proving difficult to manage on the medical ward due to his \
  wandering, agitation, and occasional aggressive outbursts without physical violence. He does not make much sense when he talks and \
  the medical team feel he is clearly psychotic and should be transferred to the inpatient psychiatry team. \
\
  The RMO is able to tell you that the patient was brought in by the police after being found unconscious in his car. His blood alcohol on \
  admission was 0.21% and he had a paracetamol level which was mildly elevated but not in the toxic range, although the exact time of \
  ingestion was not known. Benzodiazepines and cannabinoids were also detected. On examination you find the patient to have a \
  fluctuating level of consciousness. He is disoriented, highly distractible and over-active with repetitive, semi-purposeful movements. \
  He is unable to give much coherent history, and talks of seeing little creatures in his room. His affect appears fairly cheerful and he \
  tries to be cooperative. He is somewhat flushed and his chart indicates a mild pyrexia of 37.8 degrees. \
\
  Question 3.2 \
  What causes of the patient's condition should be considered and what other information (from any available source) would help \
  support or exclude these potential causes? \
  (10 marks) \
\
 A.     Alcohol withdrawal - biochemical evidence of alcohol dependence such as macrocytosis, raised GGT, raised uric acid would         O \
        support this. Collateral history about alcohol use would be helpful. \
                                                                                                                                          2 \
 B.     Delirium - known overdose; toxicology screen & collateral history helpful; anticholinergic delirium - evidence on examination of O \
        patient of anticholinergic ingestion.                                                                                             1 \
                                                                                                                                           2 \
\
 C.     Septicaemia pointed to by flushing and pyrexia. Raised WCC would support this diagnosis; look for source of infection eg. by      O \
        MSU, CXR. Check for rash or signs of meningism. \
                                                                                                                                           2 \
\
 D.     Brain injury - needs full physical and neurological examination. CT or MRI of brain.                                              O \
                                                                                                                                          1 \
                                                                                                                                          2 \
\
 E.     Delirium tremens - look for signs of autonomic instability. Lack of tremulousness is a negative.                                  O \
                                                                                                                                          1 \
                                                                                                                                           2 \
 F.     Acute intoxication from as yet unknown psychoactive substances - less likely but still possible after three days. Collateral history O \
        may help. \
                                                                                                                                           2 \

  The information that is presented in italics in questions 2, 3 and 4 of each MEQ is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case \
  vignette. \
\
   You are working as a registrar in the consultation liaison psychiatry service of a general hospital. You are contacted by the Resident \
  Medical Officer (RMO/PGY2/Senior House Officer) on a medical ward with the message that the medical service would like to transfer \
  a patient to the psychiatry service. Theo is a 25-year-old man who was admitted to the medical service three days ago after an \
  overdose involving multiple substances, not all of which are known. He is proving difficult to manage on the medical ward due to his \
   wandering, agitation, and occasional aggressive outbursts without physical violence. He does not make much sense when he talks and \
   the medical team feel he is clearly psychotic and should be transferred to the inpatient psychiatry team. \
\
   The RMO is able to tell you that the patient was brought in by the police after being found unconscious in his car. His blood alcohol on \
  admission was 0.21% and he had a paracetamol level which was mildly elevated but not in the toxic range, although the exact time of \
  ingestion was not known. Benzodiazepines and cannabinoids were also detected. On examination you find the patient to have a \
  fluctuating level of consciousness. He is disoriented, highly distractible and over-active with repetitive, semi-purposeful movements. \
  He is unable to give much coherent history, and talks of seeing little creatures in his room. His affect appears fairly cheerful and he \
  tries to be cooperative. He is somewhat flushed and his chart indicates a mild pyrexia of 37.8 degrees. \
\
  You are able to get in touch with Theo's mother. She tells you that Theo has had problems for some years with alcohol and marijuana. \
  As far as she knows he does not use heroin or amphetamines. His pattern of alcohol use is mainly one of bingeing every few weeks \
  and, when he can afford it, he uses marijuana daily. However, he lost his job a few months ago and since then he has been \
  experimenting with readily obtainable psychoactive substances such as the panadeine forte which his father is prescribed for back \
  pain. After Theo's overdose his mother noted that supplies of his father's medication for back pain and Parkinson's disease are also \
  missing - the bottles are "diazepam" and "benzhexol". \
\
  Question 3.3 \
  What is the most likely diagnosis? \
   (2 marks) \

 A.     Anticholinergic delirium.                                                                                                 O           I \

   You are able to get in touch with Theo's mother. She tells you that Theo has had problems for some years with alcohol and marijuana. \
  As far as she knows he does not use heroin or amphetamines. His pattern of alcohol use is mainly one of bingeing every few weeks \
  and, when he can afford it, he uses marijuana daily. However, he lost his job a few months ago and since then he has been \
  experimenting with readily obtainable psychoactive substances such as the panadeine forte which his father is prescribed for back \
  pain. After Theo's overdose his mother noted that supplies of his father's medication for back pain and Parkinson's disease are also \
  missing - the bottles are "diazepam" and "benzhexol". \

\
            You are the consultant psychiatrist who is asked to see Adora, a 26-year-old Filipina woman who emigrated 5 years ago. She is married to Jeff and they \
            have a 4-year-old son, Ben. Jeff works on an off-shore oil rig and is away from home two weeks each month. \
\
            Adora has few friends and no family here for support. She often finds it difficult to manage Ben on her own. Ben has been having difficulties getting to sleep. \
\
            There is conflict between Adora and Jeff over various things when he is home. \
\
            Adora was brought to hospital after she had been observed to be having a fit at her local supermarket at lunchtime. The emergency department registrar \
            believes Adora is experiencing 'pseudo seizures' and refers her to psychiatry for assessment and management. \
\
            Question 6.1 \
            You are the consultant who is called by your registrar to discuss the case after their assessment. \
            Outline (list and justify) the salient features of the history you would like your registrar to focus on. (12 marks) \

   You are the consultant psychiatrist who is asked to see Adora, a 26-year-old Filipina woman who emigrated 5 years ago. She is married to Jeff and \
   they have a 4-year-old son, Ben. Jeff works on an off-shore oil rig and is away from home two weeks each month. \

\
   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   You are the consultant psychiatrist who is asked to see Adora, a 26-year-old Filipina woman who emigrated 5 years ago. She is married to Jeff and \
   they have a 4-year-old son, Ben. Jeff works on an off-shore oil rig and is away from home two weeks each month. \
\
   Adora has few friends and no family here for support. She often finds it difficult to manage Ben on her own. Ben has been having difficulties getting to \
   sleep. \
\
   There is conflict between Adora and Jeff over various things when he is home. \
\
   Adora was brought to hospital after she had been observed to be having a fit at her local supermarket at lunchtime. The emergency department \
   registrar believes Adora is experiencing 'pseudo seizures' and refers her to psychiatry for assessment and management. \
\
   The registrar anxiously informs you that Adora is extremely distressed. The registrar believes a short admission is warranted. However, the social \
   worker is not able to organise acute care for Ben and Jeff has rung from the oil rig, angry, saying that Adora should be at home minding Ben and she is \
   'just attention seeking'. \
\
   The Emergency Department is insisting that she be discharged from their care within the next hour. \

\
             You are a junior consultant psychiatrist at a community mental health service. Bill is a 71-year-old widower living alone in his own unit. He presents to his \
             General Practitioner with a three-month history of feeling unwell with constipation, churning stomach and poor sleep. The GP can find no physical cause for \
             Bill's symptoms and commences him on sertraline 50mg daily. After six weeks, Bill is no better and the GP refers him to your clinic. Bill attends your clinic for \
             assessment, although he is sure his GP has missed a physical illness. He describes feeling listless and fatigued, having problems concentrating, and worrying \
             about his physical state. He expresses the view he is a burden on his children and would be better off dead. He has severely restricted his food intake \
             because he believes eating is aggravating his constipation. \

   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   You are a junior consultant psychiatrist at a community mental health service. Bill is a 71-year-old widower living alone in his own unit. He presents to his \
   General Practitioner with a three-month history of feeling unwell with constipation, churning stomach and poor sleep. The GP can find no physical cause for \
   Bill's symptoms and commences him on sertraline 50mg daily. After six weeks, Bill is no better and the GP refers him to your clinic. Bill attends your clinic for \
   assessment, although he is sure his GP has missed a physical illness. He describes feeling listless and fatigued, having problems concentrating, and worrying \
   about his physical state. He expresses the view he is a burden on his children and would be better off dead. He has severely restricted his food intake \
   because he believes eating is aggravating his constipation. \
\
   After your initial assessment, you make a provisional diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Bill tells you he does not want to be admitted to hospital for \
   treatment. \
\

   Please note: a list with no debate will not receive any marks.    (10 marks) \
\
                                                                                                                                                                    O \
  A.       Increase sertraline dose having regard to side effects in older people e.g. agitation, hyponatraemia, and falls (trial of sertraline to \
          date has been inadequate in dose).                                                                                                                         2 \
\
  B.      Alternative strategies: \
           \'b7   Consider alternative antidepressant strategies with differing mode of action such as SNRI, tricyclic antidepressant (severe                          O \
               depression with melancholic features may respond preferentially to therapy targeting more than one neurotransmitter system                           1 \
               but there is a risk of lethality in overdose).                                                                                                       2 \
           \'b7   Consider the addition of an antipsychotic medication in low dose, such as risperidone (possible psychotic symptoms) but there                        3 \
              is a risk of anticholinergic side effects. Consider olanzapine for its antiemetic effects and increase in appetite.                                   4 \
          \'b7    Short-term addition of short-acting benzodiazepine in low dose for anxiety, agitation (e.g. oxazepam) and sleep disturbance                          5 \
               (e.g. temazepam). Can cause confusion in the elderly.                                                                                                6 \
          \'b7    Consider use of non-benzodiazepine hypnotic (e.g. zopiclone) but risk of side effects such as constipation, agitation.                               7 \
               Smaller risk of dependence. Or consider adding in agomelatine as useful for sleep and good antidepressant. Or melatonin as                            8 \
               less likely to have cognitive problems than benzodiazepines. \
                                                                                                                                                                    O \
  C.      Pharmacological management of physical health problems like constipation and other comorbid medical problems. \
          Consider nutritional supplements.                                                                                                                          2 \

   Modified Essay 1 \
   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   You are a junior consultant psychiatrist at a community mental health service. Bill is a 71-year-old widower living alone in his own unit. He presents to his \
   General Practitioner with a three-month history of feeling unwell with constipation, churning stomach and poor sleep. The GP can find no physical cause for \
   Bill's symptoms and commences him on sertraline 50mg daily. After six weeks, Bill is no better and the GP refers him to your clinic. Bill attends your clinic for \
   assessment, although he is sure his GP has missed a physical illness. He describes feeling listless and fatigued, having problems concentrating, and worrying \
   about his physical state. He expresses the view he is a burden on his children and would be better off dead. He has severely restricted his food intake \
   because he believes eating is aggravating his constipation. \
\
   After your initial assessment, you make a provisional diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Bill tells you he does not want to be admitted to hospital for \
   treatment. \
\
   In collaboration with Bill's general practitioner, you decide Bill should be admitted to hospital, to which he eventually agrees. He is admitted to the general \
   acute mental health unit under your team. \
\
   Question 1.4 \
   Describe (list and explain) the instructions you would give to the nursing staff in their assessment of Bill. \

            Each question within this modified essay will be marked by a different examiner. The examiner marking this question will not have access \
            to your answers to the other questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and specifically. Answer this \
            question fully, even if you believe that you have partly covered its content in your answers to other questions. \
\
            You are a visiting psychiatrist working in a community mental health team three days each month, in a small rural town of 3000 people. The town is \
            located in the lands of the Wiradjuri people of Australia. \
\
            You see Donna, a 56-year-old Wiradjuri woman for urgent review. \
\
            Donna was last seen two years earlier for problems with anxiety, depression and social avoidance but she did not follow-up and was lost to care. \
            The Aboriginal mental health worker had no concerns and she was discharged back to her general practitioner (GP). \
\
            However, the GP has now referred Donna for review as her anxiety has escalated. This follows the release from jail three weeks ago, of the man who \
            sexually assaulted Donna twenty-two years ago. \
\
            He returned to town after his release and since then she has found it impossible to leave her home, she is not sleeping, and she wonders how she will \
            cope if she sees this man. She has contacted the police to ask them what to do but has found their response unhelpful. \
\
            While recognizing the patient is not suicidal, nor psychotic and has no history of such, she is extremely distressed. The GP requests your urgent advice. \
            Question 1.1 \
            Outline (list and justify) the cultural considerations relevant to your interaction with Donna. \

   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
    You are a visiting psychiatrist working in a community mental health team three days each month, in a small rural town of 3000 people. The town is \
    located in the lands of the Wiradjuri people of Australia. \
\
    You see Donna, a 56-year-old Wiradjuri woman for urgent review. \
\
   Donna was last seen two years earlier for problems with anxiety, depression and social avoidance but she did not follow-up and was lost to care. \
    The Aboriginal mental health worker had no concerns and she was discharged back to her general practitioner (GP). \
\
   However, the GP has now referred Donna for review as her anxiety has escalated. This follows the release from jail three weeks ago, of the man who \
    sexually assaulted Donna twenty-two years ago. \
\
   He returned to town after his release and since then she has found it impossible to leave her home, she is not sleeping, and she wonders how she will \
   cope if she sees this man. She has contacted the police to ask them what to do but has found their response unhelpful. \
\
   While recognizing the patient is not suicidal, nor psychotic and has no history of such, she is extremely distressed. The GP requests your urgent advice. \
\

   List the most important issues you wish to clarify in your review of this patient. \

  Modified Essay 1 \
  The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   You are a visiting psychiatrist working in a community mental health team three days each month, in a small rural town of 3000 people. The town is \
  located in the lands of the Wiradjuri people of Australia. \
\
   You see Donna, a 56-year-old Wiradjuri woman for urgent review. \
\
  Donna was last seen two years earlier for problems with anxiety, depression and social avoidance but she did not follow-up and was lost to care. \
   The Aboriginal mental health worker had no concerns and she was discharged back to her general practitioner (GP). \
\
  However, the GP has now referred Donna for review as her anxiety has escalated. This follows the release from jail three weeks ago, of the man who \
  sexually assaulted Donna twenty-two years ago. \
\
  He returned to town after his release and since then she has found it impossible to leave her home, she is not sleeping, and she wonders how she will \
  cope if she sees this man. She has contacted the police to ask them what to do but has found their response unhelpful. \
\
  While recognizing the patient is not suicidal, nor psychotic and has no history of such, she is extremely distressed. The GP requests your urgent advice. \
\
   You diagnose Donna with PTSD and would like to engage her in treatment. \
\
  Towards the conclusion of your clinical interview, Donna asks for a prescription for diazepam. The GP did not mention anything in the referral but \
  Donna says she has been using up to 40mg daily for several years. \
\

\
            You are a community based junior psychiatrist and you have recently assessed Norman, aged 84 years, who lives in an aged residential care facility for \
            people with dementia. Norman suffers from moderately severe Alzheimer's disease. \
\
            The staff are concerned that he is verbally aggressive towards staff and other residents, and occasionally he lashes out and hits staff. Some of the \
            untrained staff in the centre feel that Norman is deliberately "playing up" and are annoyed with him. \
\
            When you examine Norman he is calm but severely cognitively impaired. He has no major apparent physical problems. Recent routine laboratory \
            investigations including mid-stream urine culture are unremarkable. Norman is on no medication. The staff are giving him lorazepam 0.5mg daily on \
            an as required (PRN) basis for his verbal aggression but it has not been effective. You plan to review him in two weeks. \
\
            Question 2.1 \
            Describe (list and explain) the information you would ask the residential care staff to collect regarding Norman's difficult behaviour. \

\
   You are a community based junior psychiatrist and you have recently assessed Norman, aged 84 years, who lives in an aged residential care facility for \
  people with dementia. Norman suffers from moderately severe Alzheimer's disease. \
\
   The staff are concerned that he is verbally aggressive towards staff and other residents, and occasionally he lashes out and hits staff. Some of the \
  untrained staff in the centre feel that Norman is deliberately "playing up" and are annoyed with him. \
\
  When you examine Norman he is calm but severely cognitively impaired. He has no major apparent physical problems. Recent routine laboratory \
  investigations including mid-stream urine culture are unremarkable. Norman is on no medication. The staff are giving him lorazepam 0.5mg daily on \
  an as required (PRN) basis for his verbal aggression but it has not been effective. You plan to review him in two weeks. \
\
  When you return to the centre two weeks later, you find that the staff have not collected any information for you. \
\

            Duncan, a 30-year-old male, works as an accountant with an international accounting firm. He is well regarded by his colleagues and is expected to \
            become a partner of the firm. \
\
            You are a junior psychiatrist in the outpatient clinic of the hospital where Duncan attended following a paracetamol overdose one week ago. He made a \
            full medical recovery. \

            The overdose occurred after Duncan's wife, Maxine, discovered him looking at adult pornographic images on the internet. Duncan and Maxine have \
            been married for six years and have two children aged five years and three years. Maxine is 30 years old and she no longer works outside of the home. \
\
            Duncan is active in local community events and is involved in a program to help disadvantaged teenagers. \
\
            Duncan attends for a follow up appointment at the insistence of his wife, who is concerned about his viewing of pornography. \

   Modified Essay 3 \
   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   Duncan, a 30-year-old male, works as an accountant with an international accounting firm. He is well regarded by his colleagues and is expected to \
   become a partner of the firm. \
\
    You are a junior psychiatrist in the outpatient clinic of the hospital where Duncan attended following a paracetamol overdose one week ago. He made a \
   full medical recovery. \
\
    The overdose occurred after Duncan's wife, Maxine, discovered him looking at adult pornographic images on the internet. Duncan and Maxine have \
   been married for six years and have two children aged five years and three years. Maxine is 30 years old and she no longer works outside of the home. \
\
   Duncan is active in local community events and is involved in a program to help disadvantaged teenagers. \
\
   Duncan attends for a follow up appointment at the insistence of his wife, who is concerned about his viewing of pornography. \
\
   Duncan and Maxine request couples' therapy because of marital disharmony and a mismatch in sexual interest. \
\
   Duncan denies any paedophilic sexual attraction and is adamant that he has a heterosexual orientation. He says that he finds the images sexually \
   arousing and distracting from his day to day life. He is spending increasing amounts of time searching for and looking at these images. \
\
   During the third session, Duncan reveals that he is facing disciplinary action at work for viewing pornography on work computers. He is requesting a \
   report to his employer. \
\

            to your answers to the other questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and specifically. Answer this \
            question fully, even if you believe that you have partly covered its content in your answers to other questions. \
\
            You are the on call psychiatrist within the Emergency Department and are contacted by the psychiatry registrar about Mr Morris. He is an 80-year-old \
            widower, who has been medically cleared after a serious suicide attempt by hanging. Mr Morris believes that his suicide attempt was rational. \
\
            He has no past history of suicidal behaviours or psychiatric illness and has been physically well. Mr Morris is disappointed that his suicide attempt did \
            not work. He still believes that he should end his life. No collateral information is available. \
\
            The psychiatry registrar seeks your advice on an involuntary admission to keep him safe. \
            Question 4.1 \

  The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
  You are the on call psychiatrist within the Emergency Department and are contacted by the psychiatry registrar about Mr Morris. He is an 80-year-old \
  widower, who has been medically cleared after a serious suicide attempt by hanging. Mr Morris believes that his suicide attempt was rational. \
\
  He has no past history of suicidal behaviours or psychiatric illness and has been physically well. Mr Morris is disappointed that his suicide attempt did \
  not work. He still believes that he should end his life. No collateral information is available. \
\
   The psychiatry registrar seeks your advice on an involuntary admission to keep him safe. \
\
  Mr Morris has been admitted involuntarily to your in-patient team. His only son returns from overseas a few days later. The team is of the view that \
  Mr Morris does not have a mental illness. \
\
  Mr Morris states that he has achieved everything in life he wanted and has lived long enough. \
\
  His son says his father should remain in hospital because his father will kill himself if he is allowed home. \

  The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   You are the on call psychiatrist within the Emergency Department and are contacted by the psychiatry registrar about Mr Morris. He is an 80-year-old \
  widower, who has been medically cleared after a serious suicide attempt by hanging. Mr Morris believes that his suicide attempt was rational. \
\
  He has no past history of suicidal behaviours or psychiatric illness and has been physically well. Mr Morris is disappointed that his suicide attempt did \
  not work. He still believes that he should end his life. No collateral information is available. \
\
   The psychiatry registrar seeks your advice on an involuntary admission to keep him safe. \
\
  Mr Morris has been admitted involuntarily to your in-patient team. His only son returns from overseas a few days later. The team is of the view that \
   Mr Morris does not have a mental illness. \
\
  Mr Morris states that he has achieved everything in life he wanted and has lived long enough. \
\
  His son says his father should remain in hospital because his father will kill himself if he is allowed home. \
\
  Mr Morris is released from involuntary care and discharged home to follow-up from community team. However, he completes suicide within a week \
  after discharge from hospital. \
\
  In reviewing Mr Morris's case, you realize that your registrar did not notify the out-patient team of Mr Morris' discharge as planned and the out-patient \

\
            Amanda, aged 35 years, has had bipolar disorder since she was 24-years-old. She is married and has two pre-school aged children. Amanda had \
            frequent manic episodes in her late 20s, and had a severe postnatal psychotic depression followed by a period of hypomania after the birth of her \
            daughter, who is now 18 months old. \
\
            She is taking Sodium Valproate 1600mg and Olanzapine 20mg daily, and is currently asymptomatic. She says other mood stabilisers have not been \
            effective in preventing relapse of her bipolar disorder in the past. \
\
            You are Amanda's usual psychiatrist at the community mental health service outpatient clinic. At a routine appointment Amanda tells you that she has \
            gained over 20 kilograms on her current medication, despite her attempts to diet. She would like to stop her medication as she feels it is making her \
            look fat and disgusting. \

  Modified Essay 5 \
  The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
  Amanda, aged 35 years, has had bipolar disorder since she was 24-years-old. She is married and has two pre-school aged children. \
  Amanda had frequent manic episodes in her late 20s, and had a severe postnatal psychotic depression followed by a period of hypomania after the \
  birth of her daughter, who is now 18 months old. \
\
   She is taking Sodium Valproate 1600mg and Olanzapine 20mg daily, and is currently asymptomatic. She says other mood stabilisers have not been \
  effective in preventing relapse of her bipolar disorder in the past. \
\
   You are Amanda's usual psychiatrist at the community mental health service outpatient clinic. At a routine appointment Amanda tells you that she has \
  gained over 20 kilograms on her current medication, despite her attempts to diet. She would like to stop her medication as she feels it is making her \
  look fat and disgusting. \
\
  She manages to lose 6 kg in weight and is pleased with her success. She now informs you that she and her husband want to have the third child that \
  they had always planned. \
\
  Amanda asks your advice regarding what to do with her medication when she gets pregnant. \
\
  Question 5.2 \
  Discuss (list and debate) your response to this situation. \
  (8 marks) \
\
 A.      INFORMATION GATHERING. \
         Explore option of not having a third child in a non-judgmental way - motivations, pros, cons. \
         Ascertain whether already pregnant as this alters emphasis of discussion. Check that still using contraception.                                  1 \
         Check what happened with medication in Amanda's previous pregnancies including outcomes for the babies and for Amanda's                          2 \
         mental health.                                                                                                                                   3 \
         Encourage Amanda to bring her husband in to an appointment so that all of the risks and benefits of the various options can be                  4 \
         discussed with both of them. \
\
 B.      MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES \
         Importance of instituting plan before getting pregnant, close monitoring of mental state if changing medications to lower risk \
         mood stabilizers.                                                                                                                                1 \
         Outline current knowledge of potential risks with Valproate use during pregnancy, especially risks of foetal malformations in                    2 \
         first trimester and recommend to cease it during pregnancy. Outline risks to family and to Amanda of severe manic or depressive                  3 \
         episode including long term outcome to mother and baby.                                                                                          4 \
         Possible strategies of switching to anti-psychotic alone for early pregnancy, folate supplementation. \
\
 C.      Arrange early follow-up discussion time to review decisions and arrange next stage plus or minus referral to antenatal clinic if                O \

            You are a junior consultant at a Community Mental Health Service and you see Madelaine, a 36-year-old single woman who was diagnosed with \
            Schizophrenia at the age of 28 years. She has a history of good medication adherence but she continues to experience frequent distressing auditory \
            hallucinations. \
\
            She is currently taking risperidone 6mg per day orally, but she has significant extrapyramidal side effects. Madelaine was previously prescribed olanzapine \
            with good effect but it caused significant weight gain and she ceased it. \
\
            During your first meeting with Madelaine, she requests a change of medication. \

   Modified Essay 1 \
   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
    You are a junior consultant at a Community Mental Health Service and you see Madelaine, a 36-year-old single woman who was diagnosed with \
    Schizophrenia at the age of 28 years. She has a history of good medication adherence but she continues to experience frequent distressing auditory \
   hallucinations. \
\
    She is currently taking risperidone 6mg per day orally, but she has significant extrapyramidal side effects. Madelaine was previously prescribed olanzapine \
    with good effect but it caused significant weight gain and she ceased it. \
\
    During your first meeting with Madelaine, she requests a change of medication. \
\
   Madelaine's primary complaints are stiffness and tremor both of which she finds embarrassing, and which interfere with basic tasks. \
\
   Madelaine decides to start clozapine. Baseline blood tests (including tests of cardiac function) are all normal. Her body mass index is 22kg/m2. You start her \
   on the lowest recommended regimen. \
\
   After reaching a dose of 200mg a day in 3 weeks, she reports one incident of a hot and cold sensation the previous night. Physical examination is normal. \
   Her white cell count (WCC) is 4.2 x 10*9/L, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) is 200U/L and her troponin T is normal. An ECG showed that her QTc has increased \
   from 428ms at baseline to 492ms. \
\
   Question 1.4 \
   Outline (list and justify) the approaches to management that you would consider. \
    Please note: a list with no justification will not receive any marks. (6 marks) \
\
  A.      Consultation. Consider medical colleagues (e.g. cardiologist) and/or clozapine information service and/or specialist pharmacist.                O \
          Justification: clarification of the risk/benefit analysis of prolonged QTc.                                                                      1 \
                                                                                                                                                           2 \
\
  B.      i) Cautious continuation. Continue clozapine at the same dose and review patient in a few days: advise her to contact the service               O \
              immediately if she experiences fever, sore throat, chest pain, muscle aches, or flu like symptoms. Repeat ECG. No clear evidence             1 \
              of indication to discontinue: symptoms may settle spontaneously; blood tests are normal. Admission can be considered.                        2 \
\
          ii) Clozapine withdrawal. May be a safe option as there is an increase of the QTc but such a strategy would not provide clear                   O \
              information about the tolerance clozapine in this patient. Regular monitoring with ECG of QTc is indicated. Admission can be                1 \
              considered.                                                                                                                                  2 \
\
          iii) Cautious dose reduction. Lower the dose temporarily and increase again with frequent ECG monitoring: reason. May allow time                O \
              for physiological adjustment. Admission can be considered.                                                                                   1 \
                                                                                                                                                           2 \
\
  C.      Involve Madelaine and her key family/social supports in decision making.                                                                        O \

   Modified Essay 1 \
   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
    You are a junior consultant at a Community Mental Health Service and you see Madelaine, a 36-year-old single woman who was diagnosed with \
    Schizophrenia at the age of 28 years. She has a history of good medication adherence but she continues to experience frequent distressing auditory \
   hallucinations. \
\
    She is currently taking risperidone 6mg per day orally, but she has significant extrapyramidal side effects. Madelaine was previously prescribed olanzapine \
    with good effect but it caused significant weight gain and she ceased it. \
\
   During your first meeting with Madelaine, she requests a change of medication. \
\
   Madelaine's primary complaints are stiffness and tremor both of which she finds embarrassing, and which interfere with basic tasks. \
\
    Madelaine decides to start clozapine. Baseline blood tests (including tests of cardiac function) are all normal. Her body mass index is 22kg/m2. You start her \
   on the lowest recommended regimen. \
\
   After reaching a dose of 200mg a day in 3 weeks, she reports one incident of a hot and cold sensation the previous night. Physical examination is normal. \
   Her white cell count (WCC) is 4.2 x 10*9/L, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) is 200U/L and her troponin T is normal. An ECG showed that her QTc has increased \
   from 428ms at baseline to 492ms. \
\
   After reviewing the options available with Madelaine, she decides to continue the clozapine at its current dose. However, the following afternoon, Madelaine is \
   admitted to hospital with nausea, lethargy, fever and tachycardia. Her condition deteriorates and she is transferred to the intensive care unit. \
\
   The next morning, Madelaine's mother contacts you by telephone and accuses you of being negligent in Madelaine's care. She is nominated as Madelaine's \
   next-of-kin. \
\
   Question 1.5 \
   Describe (list and explain) how you would respond to the mother's telephone call. \

             You are a junior consultant psychiatrist employed at a community child and adolescent clinic. \
\
             A 14-year-old girl, Emily, is referred to your clinic with 15kg weight loss during the last 6 months. She describes increased food restriction over the last month, \
             eating only leafy vegetables, and jogging for at least an hour a day. She has been amenorrhoeic for 3 months. She presents as an obviously thin girl (BMI is \
             15 kg/m2) wearing oversized clothing, who believes she is still overweight and would like to be thinner. \
\

\
   Question 5.3 \
   Outline (list and justify) the strategies to reduce the risk of refeeding syndrome. \
   Please note: a list with no justification will not receive any marks. (6 marks) \
\
  A.       Treatment parameters. Multidisciplinary team with experienced dietician, regular review, index of suspicion - allow early identification \
          and tailored response. \
\
  B.       Moderate pace of refeeding - "start low and go slow" (e.g. 6000KJ/1500kcal daily in an adult) due to risk of carbohydrate-induced \
                                                                                                                                                                    O              I \
          insulin release triggering rapid intracellular electrolyte uptake - consider NG if risk of refeeding syndrome considered high - recognize                 1 \
          risk of underfeeding. \
  C.      Low carbohydrate diet/preparations to avoid triggering postprandial rebound hypoglycaemia in people with low glycogen stores.                             O \
\
  D.      Limit oral fluid intake, appropriate to age and weight because excess fluid intake may worsen electrolyte disturbance.                                    O \
\
  E.       Other electrolyte monitoring and supplementation. Potassium, Magnesium.                                                                                  O \
                                                                                                                                                                    1 \

   Modified Essay 5 \
   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   You are a junior consultant psychiatrist employed at a community child and adolescent clinic. \
\
   A 14-year-old girl, Emily, is referred to your clinic with 15kg weight loss during the last 6 months. She describes increased food restriction over the last month, \
   eating only leafy vegetables, and jogging for at least an hour a day. She has been amenorrhoeic for 3 months. She presents as an obviously thin girl (BMI is \
    15 kg/m2) wearing oversized clothing, who believes she is still overweight and would like to be thinner. \
\
    Emily is admitted to a paediatric medical ward. \
\
   Several weeks later, Emily has gained weight and is medically stable. You meet with Emily and her family for discharge planning. \
\
   During previous family meetings, Emily has complained that her parents control her life. Her father, a headmaster, is "never at home". Her mother is a \
   successful interior designer and Emily says "Nothing I do is ever good enough for her". Emily says that her mother has always been preoccupied with her own \
   appearance and weight. \
\
   Question 5.4 \
   Outline (list and justify) the treatment approaches that you would consider discussing with Emily and her parents. \
   Please note: a list with no justification will not receive any marks. (6 marks) \

                   examiner marking one question will not have access to your answers to the other two \
                   questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and \
                   specifically. For example, answer question 3 fully, even if you believe that you have partly \
                   covered its content in your answers to questions 1 and 2. \
\
                   "Andy" is a 55-year-old immigrant from Iran. He arrived in 1990 after spending several years in a \
                   refugee camp in Pakistan. He speaks limited English. He stated he was a wealthy businessman in \
                   Iran, but was persecuted and forced to leave because of his opposition to the government. He \
                   states he was tortured and beaten on several occasions and walks with a limp as a consequence. \
                   He is referred to the community mental health centre where you work as a registrar. The referring \
                   general practitioner has written that he rarely leaves home. You interview him with a professional \
                   interpreter. You determine that he has become increasingly withdrawn from his family, is \
                   irritable, cannot sleep, and has worsening back pain. He does not consume alcohol. He is \
                   prescribed anti-inflammatory medication and panadeine forte (paracetamol, codeine phosphate). \
                   for his pain. He cannot work because of the back pain. His wife does not work because she \
                   cannot speak English. They have two adolescent children. \
\
                   His general practitioner has previously referred him to the Pain Clinic at the local hospital. He is \
                   having hydrotherapy, which has helped his mobility. \

\
                  The Pain Clinic commences Andy on a low dose of amitriptyline. His sleep and irritability improve   1 \

\
                  Question 1.2 \

\
                  Andy's condition stabilises, but he remains mildly depressed and anxious. He has been living off \
                  the money that he could get out of the country when he left, and loans from other family and the \
                  community. He discloses that his financial reserves are almost depleted. \

\
                  Stan is a 37-year-old unemployed electrician who has a 20-year history of obsessive-compulsive \
                  disorder. \
                  Stan is unable to leave his house because of checking rituals. His general practitioner has \
                  referred him to the community mental health service. Stan lives with his elderly parents who \
                  shop and cook for him. He has a long history of intermittent contact with mental health services \
      [X]         but has never attended for longer than three months at a time. He has tried many different \
                  medications but has stopped them because he could not tolerate the side-effects. \

                  Question 4.1 \
                  Discuss the factors that may have contributed to Stan's poor engagement with mental health \
                  services in the past. \

\
                  You assess Stan in his home and confirm that he has no other major psychiatric disorder. Stan \
                  tells you that he has to check switches and power sockets constantly because he fears he will \
                  leave an electrical appliance on and cause harm to his parents. Similar fears have prevented him \
                 from working outside of the home. He would like treatment for his problems as long as it does not. \
                 involve admission to hospital. \

                  Question 4.2 \
                 Describe your comprehensive management plan for Stan. \

\
                 Shortly after Stan has commenced his treatment program, his elderly father dies suddenly at \
                 home of a cardiac arrest. \
                                                       6.25 \
                 Question 4.3 \
                 Discuss possible responses Stan might have to this event, and describe any additional \
                 interventions that might be necessary. \

           Stan is unable to leave his house because of checking \
                                                                         rituals. His general practitioner has referred him to the community mental \
          health service. Stan lives with his elderly parents who shop and cook for him. He has a long history of intermittent contact with \
          mental health services but has never attended for longer than three months at a time. He has tried many different medications but \
          has stopped them because he could not tolerate the side-effects. \

      Stan is a 37-year-old unemployed electrician \
                                                     who has a 20-year history of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Stan is unable to leave his \
      house because of checking rituals. His general \
                                                       practitioner has referred him to the community mental health service. Stan lives with \
      his elderly parents who shop and cook for him. \
                                                          He has a long history of intermittent contact with mental health services but has \
      never attended for longer than three months at a \
                                                           time. He has tried many different medications but has stopped them because he \
      could not tolerate the side-effects. \
      You assess Stan in his home and confirm that he                                                                       has to check \
                                                             has no other major psychiatric disorder. Stan tells you that he \
      switches and power sockets constantly because he fears he will leave an electrical appliance on and cause harm to his parents. \
      Similar fears have prevented him from working outside of the home. He would like treatment for his problems as long as it does not \
      involve admission to hospital. \

                                       rituals. His general practitioner has \
                                                                            referred him to the community mental health service. Stan \

          You assess Stan in his home \
                                           and confirm that he has no other major psychiatric disorder. Stan tells you that he has to check \
         switches and power sockets constantly \
                                                     because he fears he will leave an electrical appliance on and cause harm to his parents. \
          Similar fears have prevented him from \
                                                   working outside of the home. He would like treatment for his problems as long as it does not \
          involve admission to hospital. \
\
          Shortly after Stan has commenced his treatment program, his elderly father dies suddenly at home of a cardiac arrest. \

                examiner marking one question will not have access to your answers to the other two \
                questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and \
                specifically. For example, answer question 3 fully, even if you believe that you have partly \
                covered its content in your answers to questions 1 and 2. \
\
                Joel, a 10-year-old boy living with his parents and younger brother, is referred to you by his \
                family doctor for review of his medication. Three years ago he was diagnosed by a Paediatrician \
                as having Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Tourette's Disorder, and was \
                commenced on methylphenidate and clonidine with apparently good effect. His parents report \
                that his behaviour is settled at home and he has few tics, but he is making extremely poor \
                academic progress at school. \
\
                Question 1.1 \
                Discuss the factors which are most likely to explain Joel's poor academic progress. Include \
                your reasoning for each factor. \
                (8 marks)                                           Please write your response on page 3 \
\
               Joel's mother raises a concern about the potential side-effects of methylphenidate and stimulant \
               medication early in your assessment. She has recently read a magazine article that states that \
               children on stimulants have growth retardation and are likely to become drug addicts. \
\
               Question 1.2 \
               Outline how you would respond to Joel's mother's concerns. \
               (8marks)                                            Please write your response on page 8 \
\
               Even though Joel's ADHD has stabilised on treatment, his Tourette's Disorder is still symptomatic. \
              Joel's mother asks for your advice about management of Joel's Tourette's Disorder. \
\
              Question 1.3 \
               Outline your management of Joel's Tourette's Disorder. \

    Modified Essay 1 \
    Joel, a 10-year-old boy \
                              living with his parents and younger brother, is referred to you by his family doctor for review of his \
    medication. Three years ago he was \
                                           diagnosed by a Paediatrician as having Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and \
     Tourette's Disorder, and was \
                                  commenced on methylphenidate and clonidine with apparently good effect. His parents report that his \
    behaviour is settled at home and he has few \
                                                tics, but he is making extremely poor academic progress at school. \
     Question 1.1 \
     Discuss the factors which are most likely to                                                                 each \
                                                 explain Joel's poor academic progress. Include your reasoning for     factor. \

    D.     ADHD inadequately treated \
           eg If classroom is busy he may de distracted or receive insufficient input from teachers, the behavioural (hyperactive) features 1 \
           may have responded better than the attentional features, possible side effects of medication (e.g. clonidine) included here. 2 \
    E.     Emotional factors \
           eg Stigma from Tourette's Disorder and/or ADHD may have caused social withdrawal, he may be bullied or teased and this 1 \
           might affect capacity to learn at school, there may be family conflict at home affecting capacity to learn.           2 \

        The information that is presented in Italics In questions 2 and 3 of each MEQ is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
        Joel, a 10-year-old boy living with his parents and younger brother, is referred to you by his family doctor for review of his medication. \
         Three years ago he was diagnosed by a Paediatrician as having Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Tourette's \
        Disorder, and was commenced on methylphenidate and clonidine with apparently good effect. His parents report that his behaviour is \
        settled at home and he has few tics, but he is making extremely poor academic progress at school. \
\
        Joel's mother raises a concern about the potential side-effects of methylphenidate and stimulant medication early in your assessment. \
                                                                                                                             become drug \

      .. that Julia needs traditional healing, not medication. Julia is tearful and unable to make any \
          decision. \
\
          Question 3.3 \
          Describe how you would proceed with this situation. \

           Modified Essay 3 \
           Julia is a 23-year-old married indigenous woman who is referred by her community health nurse to the mental health team, with \
           severe depressive symptoms. Four months ago Julia's first child died at home of a "cot death" at the age of 10 weeks. Since that time \
           Julia has been persistently tearful, sleeping poorly and waking in the night because she thinks she can hear the baby crying. She is \
           avoiding social contact, losing weight, and blames herself for "not being a good mother". Her mother, who has been staying with her \
          since the baby's death, believes that the baby's death is a punishment for family wrongdoings. \

         Julia is a 23-year-old married indigenous woman who is referred by her community health nurse to the mental health team, with \
         severe depressive symptoms. Four months ago Julia's first child died at home of a "cot death" at the age of 10 weeks. Since that time \

      Julia is a 23-year-old married \
                                       indigenous woman who is referred by her community health nurse to the mental health team, with \
      severe depressive symptoms. \
                                      Four months ago Julia's first child died at home of a "cot death" at the age of 10 weeks. Since that time \
      Julia has been persistently \
                                   tearful, sleeping poorly and waking in the night because she thinks she can hear the baby crying. She is \
      avoiding social contact, losing \
                                      weight, and blames herself for "not being a good mother". Her mother, who has been staying with her \
      since the baby's death, believes \
                                       that the baby's death is a punishment for family wrongdoings. \
      After the initial assessment, \
                                    you suggest to Julia that she would benefit from antidepressant treatment. While her husband is keen \
      for her to have this \
                            treatment, Julia's mother is adamant that Julia needs traditional healing, not medication. Julia is tearful and \
      unable to make any decision. \

\
Modified Essay Questions: MEQ \
\
    .   You will be asked to mark one or two sub-questions of a modified essay problem. \
    .   MEQ answers are usually worth 1 or 2 marks, reflecting the expected amount of detail. For a 2 mark \
        answer, markers should decide whether a candidate's answer for that domain is worth 2, 1 or 0 \
        marks. \
\
    .   In some instances each sub-question within a modified essay may be marked by different markers. \
        This means that you will not see the answers candidates gave to the other sub-questions of the \
        same essay, and that you can only mark what you have in front of you. If a candidate does not \
        cover the content, but writes that he or she has answered it in another part/section of the paper, the \
        candidate cannot be given credit in the part/section of the MEQ that you are marking. We have \
        been careful to tell the candidates this very clearly at the beginning of each modified essay \
        question. We have written: \
\
              Each question within this modified essay will be marked by a different examiner. The \
              examiner marking one question will not have access to your answers to the other two \
              questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and \
              specifically. Thus, for example, answer question 3 fully, even if you believe that you have \
              partly covered its content in your answers to questions 1 and 2. \
\
    \'b7   To assist you in marking answers, questions may read "Outline your ... ", "Discuss how ... " etc. \
        This is a guide as to the type of answer to look for in a candidates response. \
\
           List means you want a list without anything extra, the list doesn't have to be explained or \
           justified. \
\
            Outline means a list with something extra that indicates a reason for its inclusion. \
\
               Marking guide for 'Outline' is as follows: \
               0 = The candidate: \
                   a. writes nothing, or little, or merely lists category heading or is overgeneralised or is \
                       wrong; and \
                   b. the candidate provides no description, explanation or rationale. \
\
         1 Discuss means a substantial answer, covering a number of points with some analysis about its \
           inclusion in the answer. \
\
           Marking guide for 'Discuss' is as follows: \
               0 = The candidate: \
                     a. writes nothing, or little, or merely lists category heading or is overgeneralised or \
                          is \
                        wrong; and \
                     b. the candidate provides no description, explanation or rationale. \
\
                1 = The candidate shows an average grasp of the issues either: \
                     a. by dealing with only one dimension of the answer but does provide in depth \
                         reasoning or description for this dimension; or \
                     b. by identifying several elements of the answer with some reasoning and \
                         description but not in any depth. \
\
               2 = The candidate shows a very good grasp of the issues \
                     a. by dealing with several dimensions of the answer providing in-depth reasoning or \
                         description; or \
                     b. by covering an extensive range of issues, each being discussed, but not \
                         necessarily to the depth of 2a. \

\
\'b7   Scoring keys reflect only one way of organizing the answer. Candidates may organize information \
    in a different manner. However, we anticipate that the scoring keys will cover the required content. \
    Markers may need to be flexible in accepting a variety of answer structures. In this case it is a \
    matter of using the scoring key provided to ensure that candidates adequately cover the required \
    content. \
\
.   If you consider that there is an additional correct answer please discuss this with your marking \
    group leader. If the group leader agrees that there is one or more additional correct answers then \
    there will be a change in the scoring key. Please immediately email the Co-Chairs of the Written \
    Subcommittee or the Secretariat of any change to the scoring key. A change in the scoring key will \
    not increase the total number of marks awarded for that part of the MEQ. Note that on the scoring \
    keys we have left a stippled box (Spare) available to be used if the decision is made that there is \
    another acceptable answer. Otherwise don't dabble with the stipple. \
\
.   To indicate your score, you simply shade in the appropriate bubble on the right hand side of the \
   page with a 2B pencil. \
\
\'b7   W bubble; (this will be included in Feedback to candidates) - mark this bubble if you find that a \
    candidate's hand writing is difficult to read, but you are able to give a score. Remember that if a \
    candidate has an illegible script you are not obliged to mark it. You must discuss such a case \
    with your marking group leader, who will discuss it with the Co-Chairs of the Writtens \
    Subcommittee. \
\
 . Please write your initials in box and indicate your allocated ID number by shading in the relevant \
    bubble at the bottom of the page (this is the small price you pay for not doing all those arithmetical \
    additions). \

          There are 5 dimensions. All are weighted equally. Every dimension is scored on a 9-point scale from 0 to 8, each point on the scale being specified. A total of 40 \
          marks is possible. This essay is marked independently by two examiners. The scores from the two examiners are averaged, so that a final score out of 40 is entered \
          into the database. If the marks given by the two examiners differ by more than 15%, a third examiner will also mark the essay, to adjudicate. \
       Dimension 1. Capacity to produce a logical argument and critical reasoning \
                                                                                                                                                                        - \

\
       Dimension 3. Ability to communicate \
          The spelling, grammar or vocabulary renders the essay extremely difficult to understand; or it is totally unintelligible.                        O \
          The spelling, grammar or vocabulary significantly impedes communication.                                                                          2 \

      The information that is presented in italics in questions 2 and 3 of each MEQ is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
      Sid is a 34-year-old single man who presented to the Emergency Department of a major teaching hospital, stating 'my life is in a mess \
      and I might harm myself or kill someone'. Sid had ceased taking prescribed medications, including venlafaxine two weeks previously, \
      and ceased taking prescribed dexamphetamine sulfate one week ago. \
      He was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) at the age of 31 years. He reported a history of difficulties with \
      concentration, sticking at and completing tasks, and being easily distracted. He was prescribed four 5 mg dexamphetamine sulfate \
      tablets each day. He admitted to frequently running out of the dexamphetamine and supplementing it with "street speed" to maintain \
      the beneficial effect. He has also started to inject crushed dexamphetamine sulfate tablets. \
      Sid is a skilled plasterer who previously worked for a small company but eventually lost his job because of erratic attendance and \
      anger control problems. He has had repeated difficulty maintaining employment. He now works for himself but is in debt because of \
      difficulty in managing his business. He says he is nervous and worries a lot. He was last admitted to a psychiatric unit three years ago, \
      after presenting to hospital complaining of mood swings and suicidal ideation. \
[ ] \
      Sid is admitted to the acute adult inpatient psychiatry unit because of his suicidal risk, and you are the registrar on the team who will \
      manage him. \
      Sid says he has not told his treating psychiatrist about his misuse of dexamphetamine sulfate and does not want him to be notified. \
      The nursing staff of the inpatient unit are interested in learning about Adult ADHD. You are asked by the director of the unit to provide \
      a 30 minute educational session to members of the staff as part of the unit's ongoing staff development programme. \

      > Lynne is an 18-year-old first year university student. She has stopped attending lectures because of panic attacks and agoraphobic \
         avoidance, and she fears that she will fail her forthcoming examinations. \
\
         Lynne moved into student accommodation when she commenced university. She has found the change very difficult. She does not \
        like the student accommodation and making friends has been difficult for her. She has no previous history_of psychiatric treatment. \
        She has consulted a psychologist at the student counselling service for support, but her panic attacks and agoraphobic avoidance \
        have not improved and she no longer wants to see this person. She consulted a general practitioner who prescribed citalopram. Lynne \
        stopped taking citalopram after a few days because it made her feel "weird". \

         The information that is presented in italics in questions 2 and 3 of each MEQ is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
         Lynne is an 18-year-old first year university student. She has stopped attending lectures because of panic attacks and agoraphobic \
         avoidance, and she fears that she will fail her forthcoming examinations. \

         have not improved and she no longer wants to see this person. She consulted a general practitioner who prescribed citalopram. Lynne \
        stopped taking citalopram after a few days because it made her feel "weird". \
\
        Having reviewed Lynne's symptoms, and excluded organic and other psychiatric disorders, you agree with Lynne that non- \
        pharmacological strategies might be useful to manage her anxiety. \
\
        'n collaboration with Lynne, you decide to treat her with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). \

        The information that is presented in italics in questions 2 and 3 of each MEQ is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
        Lynne is an 18-year-old first year university student. She has stopped attending lectures because of panic attacks and agoraphobic \
        avoidance, and she fears that she will fail her forthcoming examinations. \
\
        Lynne moved into student accommodation when she commenced university. She has found the change very difficult. She does not \
        like the student accommodation and making friends has been difficult for her. She has no previous history of psychiatric treatment. \
        She has consulted a psychologist at the student counselling service for support, but her panic attacks and agoraphobic avoidance \
        have not improved and she no longer wants to see this person. She consulted a general practitioner who prescribed citalopram. Lynne \
        stopped taking citalopram after a few days because it made her feel "weird". \
\
        Having reviewed Lynne's symptoms, and excluded organic and other psychiatric disorders, you agree with Lynne that non- \
        pharmacological strategies might be useful to manage her anxiety. \
\
        In collaboration with Lynne, you decide to treat her with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). \
\
        Lynne responds well to Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and her panic attacks decrease in frequency. However, after receiving a low \
        mark for an important university assessment, her panic attacks resume and she is considering dropping out of her course. Her \
        parents are angry at her and demand that she returns home. \

                     Each question within this modified essay will be marked by a different examiner. The \
                     examiner marking one question will not have access to your answers to the other two \
                     questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and \
                     specifically For example, answer question 3 fully, even if you believe that you have partly \
                     covered its content in your answers to questions 1 and 2. \
\
                     You are a psychiatric registrar in a psychiatric hospital that receives voluntary and involuntary \
                     patients. You are asked to see Karen, a 35-year-old married mother of three, who has been \
                     brought to the hospital by police. She had leapt out of the car driven by her husband, George, \
                    when it was stationary at traffic lights. She suffered no injury. \
\
                     Karen appears mute and preoccupied. Her husband says she has no psychiatric history. She has \
                     previously had grand mal epilepsy but has not taken her sodium valproate regularly for many \
                     months. George reports that Karen has been increasingly withdrawn and mute for several weeks. \
\
                    Question 3.1 \
                     Assuming that the account is accurate, please outline your initial management plan. \
                     (9 marks)                                            Please write your response on page 40 \
\
                     Further history from her husband, George, is that Karen has mild intellectual impairment, and \
                    that she has had some physical clumsiness and incoordination since childhood. Karen was raised \
                    by non-English-speaking parents who emigrated from a rural area of Eastern Europe before she \
                    was born. She did not attend school beyond the age of 14 years. \
\
                    George tells you that he has restraining orders against both his and her parents. He states that \
                    this is because both families are always trying to interfere.           1 \
\
                    Question 3.2 \
                    Please outline how this further history may impact on your longer-term management \
                    of Karen. \
                    (9 marks)                                            Please write your response on page 46 \
\
                    Karen recovers and is discharged from hospital. You follow her up in the outpatient clinic. After \
                    you have seen her for some months, she attends with her 10-year-old son, Jimi. Jimi repeatedly \
                    hits his mother during the interview and states that he will 'tell his father on her'. Karen alludes to \
                    domestic violence from George. She is convinced that if she were to leave him, he would 'get the \
                    kids because he says I'm crazy'. \
\
                    Question 3.3 \
                    Discuss your concerns at this time and outline your management options. \

        The information that is presented in italics in questions 2 and 3 of each MEQ is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
        You are a psychiatric registrar in a psychiatric hospital that receives voluntary and involuntary patients. You are asked to see Karen, a \
        35-year-old married mother of three, who has been brought to the hospital by police. She had leapt out of the car driven by her \
        husband, George, when it was stationary at traffic lights. She suffered no injury. \
\
        Karen appears mute and preoccupied. Her husband says she has no psychiatric history. She has previously had grand mal epilepsy \
        but has not taken her sodium valproate regularly for many months. George reports that Karen has been increasingly withdrawn and \
        mute for several weeks. \
\
        Further history from her husband, George, is that Karen has mild intellectual impairment, and that she has had some physical \
        clumsiness and incoordination since childhood. Karen was raised by non-English-speaking parents who emigrated from a rural area of \
        Eastern Europe before she was born. She did not attend school beyond the age of 14 years. \
  [ ] \
        George tells you that he has restraining orders against both his and her parents. He states that this is because both families are always \
        trying to interfere. \
\
        Question 3.2 \
        Please outline how this further history may impact on your longer-term management of Karen. (9 marks) \
\
                                                                                                                                               I \
       A.    Longer-term management of untreated epilepsy/psychosis/depression will involve forming a rapport with Karen and George, \
             and engaging them in her treatment. All the following factors will affect this. \
                                                                                                                                    2 \
\
       B.    Non-English-speaking background: clear communication, checking that she understands, repeating information about the O \
              purpose and goal of hospitalization                                                                                   2 \

                                                                                                                                    1 \

\
       D.     Limited education and low IQ: importance of providing appropriate level of information, repetition of information, maybe simple O \
              written material, ensuring that staff understand this problem \
                                                                                                                                    2 \
\
       E.    Husband's mental state: possibly paranoid, appears to be excessively controlling; may need to specifically engage him in order \
             to access Karen or, conversely, may need to encourage Karen to strengthen other relationships, etc. *                  1 \
\
       F.    Capacity of Karen and George to parent their children: need to assess the appropriateness of George's response to both sets of \
                                                                                                                                    1 \

\
       G.    Children: assess their emotional state, their safety, their isolation from both extended families, and the effect of Karen's illness \
             and low IQ.                                                                                                           2 \

\
              Modified Essay 4 \
              (25 marks) \
\
              Each question within this modified essay will be marked by a different examiner. The \
              examiner marking one question will not have access to your answers to the other two \
              questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and \
              specifically. For example, answer question 3 fully, even if you believe that you have partly \
              covered its content in your answers to questions 1 and 2. \
\
              You are working in an outpatient child and adolescent service. The clinical psychologist asks \
              you to see a 13-year-old girl, Dusty, and her mother Nancy, a single parent. Dusty has recently \
              presented with symptoms of obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviour involving fear of \
              contamination with germs. The family's water bill has increased fourfold in the past few months \
              as a result of Dusty's hand-washing and her mother's laundering of Dusty's bed linen whenever . \
              it touches the floor or touches something that has touched the floor. \
\
              The psychologist tells you that Dusty's mother, Nancy, was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia \
              about 10 years ago and is maintained on clozapine. He has found it very difficult to get any \
              information from Nancy. Dusty's younger sister, Billie, is seven years old and also lives at home. \
\
              Question 4.1 \
              Outline the issues that you would particularly attend to at your initial assessment of Dusty. \
              Give your reasons. \
              (7 marks)                                         Please write your response on page 59 \
\
           . After the initial assessment, you are unclear as to whether Dusty has a diagnosis of a primary \
              Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) or whether her symptoms are secondary to her mother's \
              condition. You arrange for a follow-up interview with Nancy, Dusty and Billie. Nancy's former \
             partner left the country six years ago and his whereabouts are unknown. Nancy is estranged from \
             her own parents. It becomes clear that Nancy is very protective of her daughters. She has \
             forbidden them to give out their address or telephone number to other children at school. She \
             will not let them go to other children's houses. She walks both daughters to and from school. \
             She believes that Dusty's fear of germs would be handled best by arranging home schooling so \
             that Dusty does not need to confront dirty environments. \
\
             Question 4.2 \
             Discuss your interventions. \
             (10 marks)                                        Please write your response on page 65 \
\
             After some months, Nancy says she does not want to keep bringing Dusty to the clinic, and \
             requests 'a cure' for Dusty's OCD. She mentions that her own psychiatrist has said he thinks \
             Dusty should be 'on medication'. Nancy has also seen 'miracle surgery' for OCD on television. \
\
             Question 4.3 \
             Discuss your response to Nancy's request. \
             (8 marks)                                         Please write your response on page 71 \

                                              MARCH          2008                                                     [X] \
\
         The information that is presented in italics in questions 2 and 3 of each MEQ is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
         You are working in an outpatient child and adolescent service. The clinical psychologist asks you to see a 13-year-old girl, Dusty, and \
         her mother Nancy, a single parent. Dusty has recently presented with symptoms of obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviour \
         involving fear of contamination with germs. The family's water bill has increased fourfold in the past few months as a result of Dusty's \
         hand-washing and her mother's laundering of Dusty's bed linen whenever it touches the floor or touches something that has touched \
         the floor. \
\
         The psychologist tells you that Dusty's mother, Nancy, was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia about 10 years ago and is \
         maintained on clozapine. He has found it very difficult to get any information from Nancy. Dusty's younger sister, Billie, is seven years \
         old and also lives at home. \
\
         After the initial assessment, you are unclear as to whether Dusty has a diagnosis of a primary Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) \
   [ ] or whether her symptoms are secondary to her mother's condition. You arrange for a follow-up interview with Nancy, Dusty and Billie. \
         Vancy's former partner left the country six years ago and his whereabouts are unknown. Nancy is estranged from her own parents. It \
        becomes clear that Nancy is very protective of her daughters. She has forbidden them to give out their address or telephone number \
        to other children at school. She will not let them go to other children's houses. She walks both daughters to and from school. She \
         believes that Dusty's fear of germs would be handled best by arranging home schooling so that Dusty does not need to confront dirty \
        environments. \
\
        After some months, Nancy says she does not want to keep bringing Dusty to the clinic, and requests 'a cure' for Dusty's OCD. She \
        mentions that her own psychiatrist has said he thinks Dusty should be 'on medication'. Nancy has also seen 'miracle surgery' for OCD \
        on television. \
\
        Question 4.3                                             2.17 \
        Discuss your response to Nancy's request. (8 marks) \
\
       A      Nature of the Approach: Be non-defensive. Understand the subtext (she may be concerned about lack of progress, or she may \
              realise how much she, herself, has been helped by clozapine and other medications).                                   1 \
                                                                                                                                     2 \
       B.     Explanation about potential medications. \
              Against medication: May not be necessary in mild to moderate OCD. Potential side effects. Stigmatization. Lethality of some 1 \
             medications, such as clomipramine, in overdose. Risk to all family members, including Billie. SSRIs may increase the risk of \
             suicidal thoughts. \
             In favour of medication: Best used in moderate to severe OCD, in conjunction with CBT / family interventions. Effects of O \
             medication last only as long as it is taken. \
                                                                                                                                    2 \
      D.     Content - psychosurgery cingulotomy. \
             Has a place for severe, intractable OCD, but only after all other treatments have failed. It is not appropriate at this early stage. \
             Other types of surgery are unproven.                                                                                   2 \
      E.     Liaise with Nancy's psychiatrist / treatment team, continue to engage Nancy in further psycho-education.               O \
\
      F.     Child protection, etc., in case the steps above fail, putting Dusty is at risk. \
                                                                                                                                    D \

                nurse that Damien, a 30 year old man diagnosed with schizophrenia, sexually assaulted her during \
                the previous night. Damien is under your care, whereas Sally is under the care of a different \

\
                Outline the most urgent actions you would need to take regarding Damien, on hearing this, \
                and why you would do these things. \

                 of ward if he were on compulsory treatment, or instituting very close nursing. \
\
                 Preserve evidence:                                                                     0 \
            B.   If it is not too late, Damien should be prevented from showering or washing max. 2      1 \
                 himself or otherwise removing evidence, until seen by the police.                       2 \
\
                 Urgent assessment: \
                 Damien needs an urgent assessment to determine his mental state. This is               0 \
            c.   both to get his account of the alleged incident, and to determine his ability to max. 2 . 1 \
                 cope with a police interrogation re his degree of psychosis and possibly                2 \
                 increased risks to self/others if he were increasingly agitated. \

               tells you that Sally, a 24 year old female patient \
                                                           recovering from a manic episode, has just told her \

               There is considerable evidence that Damien did sexually assault Sally. Damien recalls and \
               acknowledges the sexual encounter. He has active psychotic symptoms which have not yet \
               resolved with antipsychotic treatment. A forensic psychiatrist assesses Damien as having a \

                Mens rea is often translated as "guilty mind". \

                Relevance of "distorted mens rea" to Damien's Criminal Responsibility:              0 \
1          B.   Means his intent and judgement in committing the assault were distorted by his max. 2 1 \

\'ec               Relevance of distorted mens rea to the possible decision in Damien's case: \
                If Damien had distorted mens rea due to his psychosis, he would be able to \
                use an insanity defence ("not guilty by reason of insanity"). Mention                0 \
           c.   McNaughten's rules. Explanation regarding Damien having a "disease of the max. 2     1 \

               Note: the concept of "diminished responsibility" does not gain any marks as it relates to diminished \
               mens rea not distorted mens rea. \
               Also note that the answer options cover both NZ and Australia as far as \

              her                                      has no prior psychiatric history and nor does anyone in \
                  family except for her birth father \
                                                 who had no formal diagnosis but committed suicide when she \
              was two years old. He is said \
                                            to have been "moody" and also abused alcohol and was physically \
              abusive to Shayleen's mother. \
              Shayleen had a normal delivery after an \
                                                    unplanned and unwanted pregnancy. The child's father has \
              left town and is not \
                                  contactable. Shayleen is currently free of psychotic symptoms, having briefly \
              been thought-disordered and with \
                                               persecutory and grandiose delusions. These settled a week ago, \
              on quetiapine 200mgs nocte. She is also taking temazepam 20mgs nocte for sleep and is not \
              breast-feeding. Her mood is somewhat labile and irritable and her mother is having to do a lot of the \
              feeds as Shayleen is drowsy at night and reluctant to get up if the baby wakes. During the \
              appointment you notice that Shayleen either gives Jake to her mother or places him in his pram, \
              and that she seems reluctant to hold him for long. \

         Modified Essay 1 \
         Olivia is a 29-year-old, married mother of three children aged twelve months to eight years. She experienced \
         significant sexual abuse in her childhood. Olivia has just been discharged to the local community mental health team at which \
         you work, following a three-month admission to a nearby acute psychiatric inpatient unit. \
\
         Prior to admission Olivia became depressed after hearing that her brother had been found guilty of sexually assaulting his \
         stepdaughter. She developed flashbacks and nightmares of her own experiences of abuse, and had frequent panic attacks. \
         She was found by her oldest child with a cord around her neck, and admitted to hospital. \
\
         Her hospital admission was characterised by recurrent episodes of self-harm including lacerating her arms and tying cords \
         around her neck. She was treated with sodium valproate, paroxetine and diazepam. Olivia was eventually discharged on these \
         medications still symptomatic. \
\
         Question 1.1 \
         Discuss the immediate and longer term psychiatric interventions you would suggests for Olivia's previous sexual abuse. \
         Please give reasons for your choices. (7 marks) \
\
        A.     Focus of psychiatric interventions in immediate phase. \
               The primary focus should be on containment and symptom control (candidates may discuss strategies to achieve these                O            I \
               objectives in more detail).                                                                                                       1 \
               It is inappropriate to do acute exploratory work while Olivia is acutely symptomatic (candidates may discuss in more depth the     2 \
               adverse consequences of exploratory psychotherapy when a patient is unwell). \
        B.     Psycho-education and explanation of symptoms.                                                                                     O \
               Candidates may discuss the particular elements and strategies of their psycho-educational intervention.                           1 \
                                                                                                                                                 2 \
        C.     Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.                                                                                                    O \
               Simple CBT for panic or anxiety symptoms, for example, breathing, relaxation. \
               Some candidates may describe the focus and strategy of their CBT in more depth.                                                   2 \
        D.     Chain analysis.                                                                                                                   O \
               Candidates may discuss the use of chain analysis that focuses on the link between triggers of abuse reminders and self-harm. \
                                                                                                                                                  2 \
        E.     Longer term interventions.                                                                                                        O \
               When Olivia is in a stable state with respect to depression or PTSD and has stable supports, she may or may not choose to work    1 \
               psychotherapeutically on abuse issues.                                                                                            2 \
        F.     Other.                                                                                                                            0 \
               Any technique that increases her understanding of the links between abuse and her own emotional responses, and increases her      1 \
               sense of mastery and control.                                                                                                      2 \

        H.     Did not attempt                                                                                                                   [ ] \

   Olivia has just found out that she is pregnant again as a result of having sex with her husband when on weekend leave from \
   hospital. She and her husband are concerned about the effects of her psychotropic medication on the baby. \
\
   Question 1.3 \
   Outline the information and options you would discuss with Olivia and her husband. Please provide adequate detail. \
   (10 marks) \
\
  A.     Attitudes to pregnancy                                                                                                                     O \
         Sensitively discuss attitudes to pregnancy, and provide support for options Olivia and husband wish to explore. This may                   1 \
         include termination or continuation of pregnancy, given her level of unwellness. If Olivia and her husband are wishing to look at           2 \
         termination, capacity to consent may need exploring. \
  B.     Risk-benefit analysis                                                                                                                      O \
         Discuss the risks and benefits of psychotropic medication during pregnancy, especially the risk of untreated serious mental                1 \
         illness. Review current medication in terms of whether it is needed, and stop unnecessary medications. Usually by time                      2 \
         pregnancy is confirmed, the maximum risk for malformation has passed (by 8 weeks of gestation). \
  C.     Antidepressants                                                                                                                           O \
         Paroxetine is generally safe in the 1st trimester (no reported increase in foetal malformations).                                          1 \
          There is a risk of withdrawal syndrome in infants associated with use of SSRI in the 3rd trimester. There may be a need to                 2 \
         reduce dose in latter stages. \
  D.      Benzodiazepines                                                                                                                           O \
          Benzodiazepines are associated with increased incidence of cleft palate in the 1st trimester, so try to avoid them.                       1 \
          Benzodiazepines are also associated with neonatal withdrawal and floppy infant when used in the 3rd trimester.                            2 \
  E.     Valproate                                                                                                                                  O \
         Sodium valproate is associated with increased fetal malformations in the 1st trimester including cardiac and oro-facial                    1 \
         malformations. It is associated low birth weight and head circumference. Avoid if possible, if not, use a lower dose.                      2 \
  F.      Breast feeding                                                                                                                            O \
         All drugs pass into breast-milk in varying amounts. One has to evaluate the risks and benefits. Paroxetine is regarded as one of           1 \
         the safer of the antidepressants in breastfeeding mothers.                                                                                 2 \
  G.     Obstetric liaison                                                                                                                          O \
         Stress need for close monitoring of mental state and liaison with obstetric service during pregnancy                                       1 \
                                                                                                                                                    2 \
  H.     Spare (only to be used after approval has been sought from Chair, WSC). \
  I.     Did not attempt                                                                                                                           O [ ] \

\
           Maria, aged 25 years, has a history of epilepsy since early childhood with multiple seizure types, a poor response to anticonvul- \
           sants, and longstanding cognitive difficulties (her full-scale IQ is 65). She lives with her parents in a small country town, and \
           intermittently attends a supported work program packing boxes of fruit. \
\
           She was admitted in status epilepticus to a tertiary intensive care unit and was ventilated for 3 days. Two days ago, she was \
           transferred to the neurology ward. Since waking up she has been telling her parents that "everyone is spying on me with \
           satellite cameras," and that the nursing staff are saying horrible things about her. She is worried that the food is poisoned. \
\
           You are asked by the neurology team to see Maria. \
\
           Question 2.1 \
           Discuss the information you would seek prior to seeing Maria. Please give reasons for your answers. (12 marks) \

   The neurologist is happy for Maria to remain under her care as the risk of further seizures is quite high. However, the nursing \
   ward staff have now become anxious about managing Maria on the neurology ward because they feel she is "crazy" and may be \
   a danger to the other sick patients. \
\
   Question 2.3 \
   Describe how you would address the nursing staff's concerns. (7 marks) \
\
  A.     Liaison with neurology team: \

         For example, meet with neurologist and senior members of the nursing staff to seek consensus on place of management. \

  B.     Practical advice and interventions at a ward level \
         For example, advise on strategies to enhance recovery (clear advice on how to respond to her delusional beliefs, including how             0 \
         to handle the problem that she thinks food is poisoned). \
                                                                                                                                                     1 \
         Also, for example, offer input from psychiatric nursing staff regarding nursing care management of patients with psychotic                 2 \
         symptoms \
         Finally, do not underestimate the importance of a clear management plan in the case notes. \

         For example, assessing risk to Maria and to other patients. \
                                                                                                                                                    1 \
         For example, visit ward regularly to review Maria, be available to nursing staff, be clear that if her psychosis increases beyond \
                                                                                                                                                    2 \

           Modified Essay 3 \
           Lisa, aged 14 years, lives with her parents and younger sister. She is an excellent student in Year 10 and has until recently been \
           very involved in competitive gymnastics. \
\
           Lisa has been in a Paediatric ward for a week with a history of intermittent nausea and weight loss over several months. She \
           has had a full medical assessment including an abdominal ultrasound, a gastroscopy and various blood and faecal tests. \
\
           The paediatric gastroenterologist does not consider her symptoms to be due to any obvious pathological process and plans to \
           discharge her today with a six-week follow-up appointment. The nursing staff ask for referral to psychiatry because they have \
           noted that she avoids food and she has lost further weight while in hospital. They are concerned that she has an eating \
           disorder. \
\
           Lisa's parents reluctantly agree to you assessing her. \
\
           Question 3.1 \
           As part of your comprehensive psychiatric assessment, describe how you would assess Lisa's eating behaviour. \
           Do not cover the rest of the psychiatric assessment. (8 marks) \

   Modified Essay 3 \
   Following your assessment, you make a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa restrictive sub-type. There is no other co-morbid \
   psychiatric diagnosis. Lisa has a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 14.5. \
   You discuss the results of your assessment with Lisa and her parents and start arranging ongoing management. \
\
   Several hours later the gastroenterologist contacts you to say that Lisa must be transferred to a psychiatric ward because Lisa's \
   bed is needed for medical patients. A nurse takes you aside to tell you that Lisa has just told her that she will kill herself if she is \
   made to eat, but does not want her parents told about this. \

           You have recently assessed Mr Newbery, aged 84 years, who lives in a residential care centre for people with \
           dementia. Mr Newbery suffers from moderately severe Alzheimer's disease. \
\
           The staff are concerned that he is verbally aggressive towards staff and other residents, and occasionally lashes out and hits \
           staff. Some of the untrained staff in the centre feel that Mr Newbery is deliberately "playing up" and are annoyed with him. \
\
           When you examine Mr Newbery he is calm but severely cognitively impaired. He has no apparent physical problems. Recent \
           routine laboratory investigations including mid stream urine culture are unremarkable. Mr Newbery is on no medication. \
\
           Question 4.1 \
           Describe the information you would ask the residential care staff to collect regarding Mr Newbery's difficult behavior. \

            You are working as the junior consultant in a large general hospital. Tony, aged 23 years, was involved in a motorcycle accident in which he sustained \
            multiple internal injuries and an unstable neck fracture. Tony has surgery to stabilise his cervical spine and is currently immobilised in halo traction, \
            has a chest drain, and cannot be moved. \
\
            Two days after the surgery, the spinal injury team contacts you expressing concern at Tony's excessive demands for opiates. When you speak to Tony \
            he tells you that he is 'in agony' and can't sleep because of the pain in his back. He looks anxious and low in mood, but denies anxiety or depressive \
            symptoms. \
            Tony is demanding to smoke cigarettes and cannabis and says that he cannot cope with hospital without them. He has threatened to sign himself out \
            of hospital. He is verbally aggressive towards staff especially when they try to discuss the hospital smoke-free policy with him. The staff would like \
            your help in managing Tony. \
            Your registrar says the diagnosis is Antisocial Personality Disorder. \
\
            Question 4.1 \
            Describe (list and elaborate) the major diagnostic possibilities you would discuss with your registrar. (8 marks) \

  The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
  You are working as the junior consultant in a large general hospital. Tony, aged 23 years, was involved in a motorcycle accident in which he sustained \
  multiple internal injuries and an unstable neck fracture. Tony has surgery to stabilise his cervical spine and is currently immobilised in halo traction, \
  has a chest drain, and cannot be moved. \
\
  Two days after the surgery, the spinal injury team contacts you expressing concern at Tony's excessive demands for opiates. When you speak to Tony \
  he tells you that he is 'in agony' and can't sleep because of the pain in his back. He looks anxious and low in mood, but denies anxiety or depressive \
  symptoms. \
\
  Tony is demanding to smoke cigarettes and cannabis and says that he cannot cope with hospital without them. He has threatened to sign himself out \
  of hospital. He is verbally aggressive towards staff especially when they try to discuss the hospital smoke-free policy with him. The staff would like \
  your help in managing Tony. \
\
  Your registrar says the diagnosis is Antisocial Personality Disorder. \
\
  Tony gives a history of heavy use of cigarettes (30 per day) and daily cannabis use (2-3 joints per day). \
\
  Question 4.2 \
  Discuss (list and debate) what strategies you would advise your registrar might use to help Tony manage without cigarettes and cannabis. \

   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   You are working as the junior consultant in a large general hospital. Tony, aged 23 years, was involved in a motorcycle accident in which he sustained \
   multiple internal injuries and an unstable neck fracture. Tony has surgery to stabilise his cervical spine and is currently immobilised in halo traction, \
   has a chest drain, and cannot be moved. \
\
   Two days after the surgery, the spinal injury team contacts you expressing concern at Tony's excessive demands for opiates. When you speak to Tony \
   he tells you that he is 'in agony' and can't sleep because of the pain in his back. He looks anxious and low in mood, but denies anxiety or depressive \
   symptoms. \
\
   Tony is demanding to smoke cigarettes and cannabis and says that he cannot cope with hospital without them. He has threatened to sign himself out \
   of hospital. He is verbally aggressive towards staff especially when they try to discuss the hospital smoke-free policy with him. The staff would like \
   your help in managing Tony. \
\
   Your registrar says the diagnosis is Antisocial Personality Disorder. \
\
   Tony gives a history of heavy use of cigarettes (30 per day) and daily cannabis use (2-3 joints per day). \

   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   You are the on-call psychiatrist to a public hospital and you are contacted by a psychiatry registrar. \
\
   Mark is a 45-year-old single successful car salesman who has presented to the Emergency Department expressing suicidal ideation with a plan and intent. \
   He had been recently charged with sexual assault after a work function. He has no previous psychiatric history. \
\
   The registrar informs you that, on examination, Mark is distressed and tearful. Mark is fearful of legal costs. He reports he cannot recall the incident on the \
   night and states that he was very intoxicated that night. Mark says he will kill himself if he is jailed. He has stated that he is too ashamed to discuss this \
   matter with his parents. \
\
   A bed is available but the registrar expresses uncertainty about whether or not to admit Mark to an inpatient unit. \
\
   Question 4.2 \
   Outline (list and justify) what in Mark's history and presentation would indicate that he needs admission. (6 marks) \

   Modified Essay 4 \
   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   You are the on-call psychiatrist to a public hospital and you are contacted by a psychiatry registrar. \
\
   Mark is a 45-year-old single successful car salesman who has presented to the Emergency Department expressing suicidal ideation with a plan and intent. \
   He had been recently charged with sexual assault after a work function. He has no previous psychiatric history. \
\
    The registrar informs you that, on examination, Mark is distressed and tearful. Mark is fearful of legal costs. He reports he cannot recall the incident on the \
   night and states that he was very intoxicated that night. Mark says he will kill himself if he is jailed. He has stated that he is too ashamed to discuss this \
   matter with his parents. \
\
   A bed is available but the registrar expresses uncertainty about whether or not to admit Mark to an inpatient unit. \
\
   A few weeks later, the registrar contacts you, advising that they have received a request from Mark's solicitor (with signed consent) asking for a report \
   regarding the assessment on the night of his presentation. Your service has a policy of responding to such requests. \
\
   Your registrar asks your advice on how to prepare such a report. \
\
   Question 4.3 \
   Describe (list and explain) your advice to the registrar. (6 marks) \
\
  A.       Teach/explain differences between treating doctor report/statement and forensic reports.                                                                 O \
                                                                                                                                                                     1 \
\
  B.       Review the RANZCP Statement on reports to the court.                                                                                                     O \

           Avoid speculation about mental state at the time of the alleged offence and about any future risky behavior. \
                                                                                                                                                                     2 \
                                                                                                                                                                    3 \
\
  D.       Advise registrar that once they prepare the report they may want to run it by legal services.                                                            O \

\
  E.       The registrar is to advise the solicitor they would need to get an independent assessment if they want an opinion about any forensic matters;            O \
          if other mental health clinicians were involved in the treatment (inpatient or community) the solicitor may want a treating doctor report from            1 \
           those involved.                                                                                                                                           2 \

            You are the consultant psychiatrist treating Paul, aged 51 years. He was admitted ten days ago to the acute psychiatric unit in which you work with a \
            diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features. He was commenced on fluoxetine 20mg daily one week prior to admission and \
            risperidone 3mg daily was added on admission. Paul's mental state had begun to improve and the level of nursing observation was reduced. \
\
            When you arrive at work early on Monday morning, you are told that Paul hanged himself in a ward bathroom during the weekend and that attempts to \
            resuscitate him had been unsuccessful. \
\

   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   You are the consultant psychiatrist treating Paul, aged 51 years. He was admitted ten days ago to the acute psychiatric unit in which you work with a \
   diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features. He was commenced on fluoxetine 20mg daily one week prior to admission and \
   risperidone 3mg daily was added on admission. Paul's mental state had begun to improve and the level of nursing observation was reduced. \
\
   When you arrive at work early on Monday morning, you are told that Paul hanged himself in a ward bathroom during the weekend and that attempts to \
   resuscitate him had been unsuccessful. \
\
   You receive a phone-call from Paul's ex-wife, Helen, who has been contacted by the police as next-of-kin and informed of his death. Helen wants to \
   know what she should say to her 12 year old son, Tim, as he does not yet know that his father has died. Helen wonders if she should avoid telling Tim \
   that the cause of death was suicide. Tim last saw his father two months ago when he stayed with him for the school holidays. \
\
   Question 1.2 \
   Outline (list and detail) the information and advice you would give to Helen to help with Tim. (6 marks) \
\
  A.      GENERAL PRINCIPLES                                                                                                                        O \
          Importance of honesty with children. Children cope better if given straight-forward information delivered in a developmentally            1 \
         appropriate fashion.                                                                                                                        2 \
  B.      GRIEF AND LOSS                                                                                                                            O \
         Likely reactions in the child given the child's temperament, the meaning of the loss of a father and his relationship with his father.     1 \
         Assist mother to understand that Tim is likely to have different thoughts and feelings about the death than what she will have.            2 \
         Advise that children will often think they are to blame. \
  C.      SPECIFIC EXPLANATION \
                                                                                                                                                    O \
                                                                                  did not love him and that there is no blame. \
          Explanation that the father was very ill. That it didn't mean that the father                                                             1 \
          Reassurance that the mother will be okay and that she is always available. The issue of attendance at the funeral depends upon the        2 \
         child's needs and wishes. \
\
  D.      POSSIBLE MEETING                                                                                                                          O \
         Discuss whether she would like to meet with you and the registrar.                                                                         1 \
  E.      ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS \
                                                                                                                                                    O \
         Discuss with the mother what additional supports may be available if required for her and for Tim. For example, other family \
                                                                                                                                                    1 \

\
   You are the consultant psychiatrist treating Paul, aged 51 years. He was admitted ten days ago to the acute psychiatric unit in which you work with a \
   diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features. He was commenced on fluoxetine 20mg daily one week prior to admission and \
   risperidone 3mg daily was added on admission. Paul's mental state had begun to improve and the level of nursing observation was reduced. \
\
   When you arrive at work early on Monday morning, you are told that Paul hanged himself in a ward bathroom during the weekend and that attempts to \
   resuscitate him had been unsuccessful. \
\
   You receive a phone-call from Paul's ex-wife, Helen, who has been contacted by the police as next-of-kin and informed of his death. Helen wants to \
   know what she should say to her 12 year old son, Tim, as he does not yet know that his father has died. Helen wonders if she should avoid telling Tim \
   that the cause of death was suicide. Tim last saw his father two months ago when he stayed with him for the school holidays. \
\
   Four days later, you notice that the nursing staff are keeping all of the patients on high levels of observation, and are reluctant to let any patients have \
   leave. The nurses are also complaining that there are not enough staff to provide adequate patient care. \

           You are working as a registrar in the consultation liaison psychiatry service of a general hospital. You are contacted by the Resident \
           Medical Officer (RMO/PGY2/Senior House Officer) on a medical ward with the message that the medical service would like to transfer \
           a patient to the psychiatry service. Theo is a 25-year-old man who was admitted to the medical service three days ago after an \
           overdose involving multiple substances, not all of which are known. He is proving difficult to manage on the medical ward due to his \
           wandering, agitation, and occasional aggressive outbursts without physical violence. He does not make much sense when he talks and \
           the medical team feel he is clearly psychotic and should be transferred to the inpatient psychiatry team. \
\
           Question 3.1 \
           Outline your approach to managing this situation. \
           (6 marks) \
\
          A.     Preparation for task: Discuss the situation with the RMO to obtain as much clinical information as you can. Explain that you are O \
                 happy to assess the patient but that you cannot promise that they will be transferred to a psychiatric ward as this may not be the \
                 most appropriate course of action.                                                                                                2 \
          B.     Nature of interaction: The approach is respectful and involves an exchange of information.                                        O \
                                                                                                                                                   1 \
          C.     Extra Information: Action: Review the clinical notes and investigation results. Obtain clinical information from nursing staff and O \
                 available medical staff. Obtain collateral history from family, including psychiatric and medical history.                        1 \
                                                                                                                                                    2 \
\
          D.     Action: Go to the ward as soon as practicable. Examine the patient. Formulate an opinion and record it in the notes before or     O \
                 after discussion with supervisor (discussion with supervisor essential).                                                          1 \

\
  The information that is presented in italics in questions 2, 3 and 4 of each MEQ is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case \
  vignette. \
\
  You are working as a registrar in the consultation liaison psychiatry service of a general hospital. You are contacted by the Resident \
  Medical Officer (RMO/PGY2/Senior House Officer) on a medical ward with the message that the medical service would like to transfer \
  a patient to the psychiatry service. Theo is a 25-year-old man who was admitted to the medical service three days ago after an \
  overdose involving multiple substances, not all of which are known. He is proving difficult to manage on the medical ward due to his \
  wandering, agitation, and occasional aggressive outbursts without physical violence. He does not make much sense when he talks and \
  the medical team feel he is clearly psychotic and should be transferred to the inpatient psychiatry team. \
\
  The RMO is able to tell you that the patient was brought in by the police after being found unconscious in his car. His blood alcohol on \
  admission was 0.21% and he had a paracetamol level which was mildly elevated but not in the toxic range, although the exact time of \
  ingestion was not known. Benzodiazepines and cannabinoids were also detected. On examination you find the patient to have a \
  fluctuating level of consciousness. He is disoriented, highly distractible and over-active with repetitive, semi-purposeful movements. \
  He is unable to give much coherent history, and talks of seeing little creatures in his room. His affect appears fairly cheerful and he \
  tries to be cooperative. He is somewhat flushed and his chart indicates a mild pyrexia of 37.8 degrees. \
\
  Question 3.2 \
  What causes of the patient's condition should be considered and what other information (from any available source) would help \
  support or exclude these potential causes? \
  (10 marks) \
\
 A.     Alcohol withdrawal - biochemical evidence of alcohol dependence such as macrocytosis, raised GGT, raised uric acid would         O \
        support this. Collateral history about alcohol use would be helpful. \
                                                                                                                                          2 \
 B.     Delirium - known overdose; toxicology screen & collateral history helpful; anticholinergic delirium - evidence on examination of O \
        patient of anticholinergic ingestion.                                                                                             1 \
                                                                                                                                           2 \
\
 C.     Septicaemia pointed to by flushing and pyrexia. Raised WCC would support this diagnosis; look for source of infection eg. by      O \
        MSU, CXR. Check for rash or signs of meningism. \
                                                                                                                                           2 \

 E.     Delirium tremens - look for signs of autonomic instability. Lack of tremulousness is a negative.                                  O \

  The information that is presented in italics in questions 2, 3 and 4 of each MEQ is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case \
  vignette. \
\
   You are working as a registrar in the consultation liaison psychiatry service of a general hospital. You are contacted by the Resident \
  Medical Officer (RMO/PGY2/Senior House Officer) on a medical ward with the message that the medical service would like to transfer \
  a patient to the psychiatry service. Theo is a 25-year-old man who was admitted to the medical service three days ago after an \
  overdose involving multiple substances, not all of which are known. He is proving difficult to manage on the medical ward due to his \
   wandering, agitation, and occasional aggressive outbursts without physical violence. He does not make much sense when he talks and \
   the medical team feel he is clearly psychotic and should be transferred to the inpatient psychiatry team. \
\
   The RMO is able to tell you that the patient was brought in by the police after being found unconscious in his car. His blood alcohol on \
  admission was 0.21% and he had a paracetamol level which was mildly elevated but not in the toxic range, although the exact time of \
  ingestion was not known. Benzodiazepines and cannabinoids were also detected. On examination you find the patient to have a \
  fluctuating level of consciousness. He is disoriented, highly distractible and over-active with repetitive, semi-purposeful movements. \
  He is unable to give much coherent history, and talks of seeing little creatures in his room. His affect appears fairly cheerful and he \
  tries to be cooperative. He is somewhat flushed and his chart indicates a mild pyrexia of 37.8 degrees. \
\
  You are able to get in touch with Theo's mother. She tells you that Theo has had problems for some years with alcohol and marijuana. \
  As far as she knows he does not use heroin or amphetamines. His pattern of alcohol use is mainly one of bingeing every few weeks \
  and, when he can afford it, he uses marijuana daily. However, he lost his job a few months ago and since then he has been \
  experimenting with readily obtainable psychoactive substances such as the panadeine forte which his father is prescribed for back \
  pain. After Theo's overdose his mother noted that supplies of his father's medication for back pain and Parkinson's disease are also \
  missing - the bottles are "diazepam" and "benzhexol". \

            Each question within this modified essay question will be marked by a different examiner. The examiner marking one question will not have \
            access to your answers to the other two questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and specifically. For \
            example, answer question 6.4 fully, even if you believe that you have partly covered its content in your answers to questions 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3. \
\
            You are the consultant psychiatrist who is asked to see Adora, a 26-year-old Filipina woman who emigrated 5 years ago. She is married to Jeff and they \
            have a 4-year-old son, Ben. Jeff works on an off-shore oil rig and is away from home two weeks each month. \
\
            Adora has few friends and no family here for support. She often finds it difficult to manage Ben on her own. Ben has been having difficulties getting to sleep. \
\
            There is conflict between Adora and Jeff over various things when he is home. \
\
            Adora was brought to hospital after she had been observed to be having a fit at her local supermarket at lunchtime. The emergency department registrar \
            believes Adora is experiencing 'pseudo seizures' and refers her to psychiatry for assessment and management. \
\
            Question 6.1 \
            You are the consultant who is called by your registrar to discuss the case after their assessment. \
            Outline (list and justify) the salient features of the history you would like your registrar to focus on. (12 marks) \

   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   You are the consultant psychiatrist who is asked to see Adora, a 26-year-old Filipina woman who emigrated 5 years ago. She is married to Jeff and \
   they have a 4-year-old son, Ben. Jeff works on an off-shore oil rig and is away from home two weeks each month. \
\
   Adora has few friends and no family here for support. She often finds it difficult to manage Ben on her own. Ben has been having difficulties getting to \
   sleep. \
\
   There is conflict between Adora and Jeff over various things when he is home. \
\
   Adora was brought to hospital after she had been observed to be having a fit at her local supermarket at lunchtime. The emergency department \
   registrar believes Adora is experiencing 'pseudo seizures' and refers her to psychiatry for assessment and management. \
\
   The registrar anxiously informs you that Adora is extremely distressed. The registrar believes a short admission is warranted. However, the social \
   worker is not able to organise acute care for Ben and Jeff has rung from the oil rig, angry, saying that Adora should be at home minding Ben and she is \
   'just attention seeking'. \
\
   The Emergency Department is insisting that she be discharged from their care within the next hour. \

\
             You are a junior consultant psychiatrist at a community mental health service. Bill is a 71-year-old widower living alone in his own unit. He presents to his \
             General Practitioner with a three-month history of feeling unwell with constipation, churning stomach and poor sleep. The GP can find no physical cause for \
             Bill's symptoms and commences him on sertraline 50mg daily. After six weeks, Bill is no better and the GP refers him to your clinic. Bill attends your clinic for \
             assessment, although he is sure his GP has missed a physical illness. He describes feeling listless and fatigued, having problems concentrating, and worrying \
             about his physical state. He expresses the view he is a burden on his children and would be better off dead. He has severely restricted his food intake \
             because he believes eating is aggravating his constipation. \

   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   You are a junior consultant psychiatrist at a community mental health service. Bill is a 71-year-old widower living alone in his own unit. He presents to his \
   General Practitioner with a three-month history of feeling unwell with constipation, churning stomach and poor sleep. The GP can find no physical cause for \
   Bill's symptoms and commences him on sertraline 50mg daily. After six weeks, Bill is no better and the GP refers him to your clinic. Bill attends your clinic for \
   assessment, although he is sure his GP has missed a physical illness. He describes feeling listless and fatigued, having problems concentrating, and worrying \
   about his physical state. He expresses the view he is a burden on his children and would be better off dead. He has severely restricted his food intake \
   because he believes eating is aggravating his constipation. \
\
   After your initial assessment, you make a provisional diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Bill tells you he does not want to be admitted to hospital for \
   treatment. \
\
   Question 1.2 \
   List clinical factors which would be important in determining whether inpatient treatment is required.                   (5 marks) \

   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   You are a junior consultant psychiatrist at a community mental health service. Bill is a 71-year-old widower living alone in his own unit. He presents to his \
   General Practitioner with a three-month history of feeling unwell with constipation, churning stomach and poor sleep. The GP can find no physical cause for \
   Bill's symptoms and commences him on sertraline 50mg daily. After six weeks, Bill is no better and the GP refers him to your clinic. Bill attends your clinic for \
   assessment, although he is sure his GP has missed a physical illness. He describes feeling listless and fatigued, having problems concentrating, and worrying \
   about his physical state. He expresses the view he is a burden on his children and would be better off dead. He has severely restricted his food intake \
   because he believes eating is aggravating his constipation. \
\
   After your initial assessment, you make a provisional diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Bill tells you he does not want to be admitted to hospital for \
   treatment. \
\
   Question 1.3 \
   Discuss (list and debate) possible strategies for pharmacological management of Bill's illness. \
   Please note: a list with no debate will not receive any marks.    (10 marks) \
\
                                                                                                                                                                    O \
  A.       Increase sertraline dose having regard to side effects in older people e.g. agitation, hyponatraemia, and falls (trial of sertraline to \
          date has been inadequate in dose).                                                                                                                         2 \
\
  B.      Alternative strategies: \
           \'b7   Consider alternative antidepressant strategies with differing mode of action such as SNRI, tricyclic antidepressant (severe                          O \
               depression with melancholic features may respond preferentially to therapy targeting more than one neurotransmitter system                           1 \
               but there is a risk of lethality in overdose).                                                                                                       2 \
           \'b7   Consider the addition of an antipsychotic medication in low dose, such as risperidone (possible psychotic symptoms) but there                        3 \
              is a risk of anticholinergic side effects. Consider olanzapine for its antiemetic effects and increase in appetite.                                   4 \
          \'b7    Short-term addition of short-acting benzodiazepine in low dose for anxiety, agitation (e.g. oxazepam) and sleep disturbance                          5 \
               (e.g. temazepam). Can cause confusion in the elderly.                                                                                                6 \
          \'b7    Consider use of non-benzodiazepine hypnotic (e.g. zopiclone) but risk of side effects such as constipation, agitation.                               7 \
               Smaller risk of dependence. Or consider adding in agomelatine as useful for sleep and good antidepressant. Or melatonin as                            8 \
               less likely to have cognitive problems than benzodiazepines. \
                                                                                                                                                                    O \
  C.      Pharmacological management of physical health problems like constipation and other comorbid medical problems. \

   Modified Essay 1 \
   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   You are a junior consultant psychiatrist at a community mental health service. Bill is a 71-year-old widower living alone in his own unit. He presents to his \
   General Practitioner with a three-month history of feeling unwell with constipation, churning stomach and poor sleep. The GP can find no physical cause for \
   Bill's symptoms and commences him on sertraline 50mg daily. After six weeks, Bill is no better and the GP refers him to your clinic. Bill attends your clinic for \
   assessment, although he is sure his GP has missed a physical illness. He describes feeling listless and fatigued, having problems concentrating, and worrying \
   about his physical state. He expresses the view he is a burden on his children and would be better off dead. He has severely restricted his food intake \
   because he believes eating is aggravating his constipation. \
\
   After your initial assessment, you make a provisional diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Bill tells you he does not want to be admitted to hospital for \
   treatment. \
\
   In collaboration with Bill's general practitioner, you decide Bill should be admitted to hospital, to which he eventually agrees. He is admitted to the general \
   acute mental health unit under your team. \
\
   Question 1.4 \
   Describe (list and explain) the instructions you would give to the nursing staff in their assessment of Bill. \

            Each question within this modified essay will be marked by a different examiner. The examiner marking this question will not have access \
            to your answers to the other questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and specifically. Answer this \
            question fully, even if you believe that you have partly covered its content in your answers to other questions. \
\
            You are a visiting psychiatrist working in a community mental health team three days each month, in a small rural town of 3000 people. The town is \
            located in the lands of the Wiradjuri people of Australia. \
\
            You see Donna, a 56-year-old Wiradjuri woman for urgent review. \
\
            Donna was last seen two years earlier for problems with anxiety, depression and social avoidance but she did not follow-up and was lost to care. \
            The Aboriginal mental health worker had no concerns and she was discharged back to her general practitioner (GP). \
\
            However, the GP has now referred Donna for review as her anxiety has escalated. This follows the release from jail three weeks ago, of the man who \
            sexually assaulted Donna twenty-two years ago. \
\
            He returned to town after his release and since then she has found it impossible to leave her home, she is not sleeping, and she wonders how she will \
            cope if she sees this man. She has contacted the police to ask them what to do but has found their response unhelpful. \
\
            While recognizing the patient is not suicidal, nor psychotic and has no history of such, she is extremely distressed. The GP requests your urgent advice. \
            Question 1.1 \
            Outline (list and justify) the cultural considerations relevant to your interaction with Donna. \

   Modified Essay 1 \
   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
    You are a visiting psychiatrist working in a community mental health team three days each month, in a small rural town of 3000 people. The town is \
    located in the lands of the Wiradjuri people of Australia. \
\
    You see Donna, a 56-year-old Wiradjuri woman for urgent review. \
\
   Donna was last seen two years earlier for problems with anxiety, depression and social avoidance but she did not follow-up and was lost to care. \
    The Aboriginal mental health worker had no concerns and she was discharged back to her general practitioner (GP). \
\
   However, the GP has now referred Donna for review as her anxiety has escalated. This follows the release from jail three weeks ago, of the man who \
    sexually assaulted Donna twenty-two years ago. \
\
   He returned to town after his release and since then she has found it impossible to leave her home, she is not sleeping, and she wonders how she will \
   cope if she sees this man. She has contacted the police to ask them what to do but has found their response unhelpful. \
\
   While recognizing the patient is not suicidal, nor psychotic and has no history of such, she is extremely distressed. The GP requests your urgent advice. \
\

  Modified Essay 1 \
  The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   You are a visiting psychiatrist working in a community mental health team three days each month, in a small rural town of 3000 people. The town is \
  located in the lands of the Wiradjuri people of Australia. \
\
  You see Donna, a 56-year-old Wiradjuri woman for urgent review. \
\
  Donna was last seen two years earlier for problems with anxiety, depression and social avoidance but she did not follow-up and was lost to care. \
   The Aboriginal mental health worker had no concerns and she was discharged back to her general practitioner (GP). \
\
  However, the GP has now referred Donna for review as her anxiety has escalated. This follows the release from jail three weeks ago, of the man who \
  sexually assaulted Donna twenty-two years ago. \
\
  He returned to town after his release and since then she has found it impossible to leave her home, she is not sleeping, and she wonders how she will \
  cope if she sees this man. She has contacted the police to ask them what to do but has found their response unhelpful. \
\
   While recognizing the patient is not suicidal, nor psychotic and has no history of such, she is extremely distressed. The GP requests your urgent advice. \
\
  You diagnose Donna with PTSD and would like to engage her in treatment. \
\

  Modified Essay 1 \
  The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   You are a visiting psychiatrist working in a community mental health team three days each month, in a small rural town of 3000 people. The town is \
  located in the lands of the Wiradjuri people of Australia. \
\
   You see Donna, a 56-year-old Wiradjuri woman for urgent review. \
\
  Donna was last seen two years earlier for problems with anxiety, depression and social avoidance but she did not follow-up and was lost to care. \
   The Aboriginal mental health worker had no concerns and she was discharged back to her general practitioner (GP). \
\
  However, the GP has now referred Donna for review as her anxiety has escalated. This follows the release from jail three weeks ago, of the man who \
  sexually assaulted Donna twenty-two years ago. \
\
  He returned to town after his release and since then she has found it impossible to leave her home, she is not sleeping, and she wonders how she will \
  cope if she sees this man. She has contacted the police to ask them what to do but has found their response unhelpful. \
\
  While recognizing the patient is not suicidal, nor psychotic and has no history of such, she is extremely distressed. The GP requests your urgent advice. \
\
   You diagnose Donna with PTSD and would like to engage her in treatment. \
\
  Towards the conclusion of your clinical interview, Donna asks for a prescription for diazepam. The GP did not mention anything in the referral but \
  Donna says she has been using up to 40mg daily for several years. \
\

            Each question within this modified essay will be marked by a different examiner. The examiner marking this question will not have access \
            to your answers to the other questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and specifically. Answer this \
            question fully, even if you believe that you have partly covered its content in your answers to other questions. \
\
            You are a community based junior psychiatrist and you have recently assessed Norman, aged 84 years, who lives in an aged residential care facility for \
            people with dementia. Norman suffers from moderately severe Alzheimer's disease. \
\
            The staff are concerned that he is verbally aggressive towards staff and other residents, and occasionally he lashes out and hits staff. Some of the \
            untrained staff in the centre feel that Norman is deliberately "playing up" and are annoyed with him. \
\
            When you examine Norman he is calm but severely cognitively impaired. He has no major apparent physical problems. Recent routine laboratory \
            investigations including mid-stream urine culture are unremarkable. Norman is on no medication. The staff are giving him lorazepam 0.5mg daily on \
            an as required (PRN) basis for his verbal aggression but it has not been effective. You plan to review him in two weeks. \
\
            Question 2.1 \
            Describe (list and explain) the information you would ask the residential care staff to collect regarding Norman's difficult behaviour. \

\
   You are a community based junior psychiatrist and you have recently assessed Norman, aged 84 years, who lives in an aged residential care facility for \
  people with dementia. Norman suffers from moderately severe Alzheimer's disease. \
\
   The staff are concerned that he is verbally aggressive towards staff and other residents, and occasionally he lashes out and hits staff. Some of the \
  untrained staff in the centre feel that Norman is deliberately "playing up" and are annoyed with him. \
\
  When you examine Norman he is calm but severely cognitively impaired. He has no major apparent physical problems. Recent routine laboratory \
  investigations including mid-stream urine culture are unremarkable. Norman is on no medication. The staff are giving him lorazepam 0.5mg daily on \
  an as required (PRN) basis for his verbal aggression but it has not been effective. You plan to review him in two weeks. \
\
  When you return to the centre two weeks later, you find that the staff have not collected any information for you. \
\
  Question 2.2 \
  Describe (list and explain) the barriers to care staff collecting such information. \

  Modified Essay 3 \
  The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
  Duncan, a 30-year-old male, works as an accountant with an international accounting firm. He is well regarded by his colleagues and is expected to \
  become a partner of the firm. \
\
   You are a junior psychiatrist in the outpatient clinic of the hospital where Duncan attended following a paracetamol overdose one week ago. He made a \
  full medical recovery. \
\
   The overdose occurred after Duncan's wife, Maxine, discovered him looking at adult pornographic images on the internet. Duncan and Maxine have \
  been married for six years and have two children aged five years and three years. Maxine is 30 years old and she no longer works outside of the home. \
\
  Duncan is active in local community events and is involved in a program to help disadvantaged teenagers. \
\
  Duncan attends for a follow up appointment at the insistence of his wife, who is concerned about his viewing of pornography. \
\
  Duncan and Maxine request couples' therapy because of marital disharmony and a mismatch in sexual interest. \
\
  Duncan denies any paedophilic sexual attraction and is adamant that he has a heterosexual orientation. He says that he finds the images sexually \
  arousing and distracting from his day to day life. He is spending increasing amounts of time searching for and looking at these images. \
\
  Question 3.3 \
  Describe (list and explain) the possible barriers to engaging with Duncan. \

   Modified Essay 3 \
   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   Duncan, a 30-year-old male, works as an accountant with an international accounting firm. He is well regarded by his colleagues and is expected to \
   become a partner of the firm. \
\
    You are a junior psychiatrist in the outpatient clinic of the hospital where Duncan attended following a paracetamol overdose one week ago. He made a \
   full medical recovery. \
\
    The overdose occurred after Duncan's wife, Maxine, discovered him looking at adult pornographic images on the internet. Duncan and Maxine have \
   been married for six years and have two children aged five years and three years. Maxine is 30 years old and she no longer works outside of the home. \
\
   Duncan is active in local community events and is involved in a program to help disadvantaged teenagers. \
\
   Duncan attends for a follow up appointment at the insistence of his wife, who is concerned about his viewing of pornography. \
\
   Duncan and Maxine request couples' therapy because of marital disharmony and a mismatch in sexual interest. \
\
   Duncan denies any paedophilic sexual attraction and is adamant that he has a heterosexual orientation. He says that he finds the images sexually \
   arousing and distracting from his day to day life. He is spending increasing amounts of time searching for and looking at these images. \
\
   During the third session, Duncan reveals that he is facing disciplinary action at work for viewing pornography on work computers. He is requesting a \
   report to his employer. \
\

            question fully, even if you believe that you have partly covered its content in your answers to other questions. \
\
            You are the on call psychiatrist within the Emergency Department and are contacted by the psychiatry registrar about Mr Morris. He is an 80-year-old \
            widower, who has been medically cleared after a serious suicide attempt by hanging. Mr Morris believes that his suicide attempt was rational. \
\
            He has no past history of suicidal behaviours or psychiatric illness and has been physically well. Mr Morris is disappointed that his suicide attempt did \
            not work. He still believes that he should end his life. No collateral information is available. \
\
            The psychiatry registrar seeks your advice on an involuntary admission to keep him safe. \

  Modified Essay 4 \
  The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
  You are the on call psychiatrist within the Emergency Department and are contacted by the psychiatry registrar about Mr Morris. He is an 80-year-old \
  widower, who has been medically cleared after a serious suicide attempt by hanging. Mr Morris believes that his suicide attempt was rational. \
\
  He has no past history of suicidal behaviours or psychiatric illness and has been physically well. Mr Morris is disappointed that his suicide attempt did \
  not work. He still believes that he should end his life. No collateral information is available. \
\
   The psychiatry registrar seeks your advice on an involuntary admission to keep him safe. \
\
  Mr Morris has been admitted involuntarily to your in-patient team. His only son returns from overseas a few days later. The team is of the view that \
  Mr Morris does not have a mental illness. \
\
  Mr Morris states that he has achieved everything in life he wanted and has lived long enough. \
\
  His son says his father should remain in hospital because his father will kill himself if he is allowed home. \

  The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   You are the on call psychiatrist within the Emergency Department and are contacted by the psychiatry registrar about Mr Morris. He is an 80-year-old \
  widower, who has been medically cleared after a serious suicide attempt by hanging. Mr Morris believes that his suicide attempt was rational. \
\
  He has no past history of suicidal behaviours or psychiatric illness and has been physically well. Mr Morris is disappointed that his suicide attempt did \
  not work. He still believes that he should end his life. No collateral information is available. \
\
   The psychiatry registrar seeks your advice on an involuntary admission to keep him safe. \
\
  Mr Morris has been admitted involuntarily to your in-patient team. His only son returns from overseas a few days later. The team is of the view that \
   Mr Morris does not have a mental illness. \
\
  Mr Morris states that he has achieved everything in life he wanted and has lived long enough. \
\
  His son says his father should remain in hospital because his father will kill himself if he is allowed home. \
\
  Mr Morris is released from involuntary care and discharged home to follow-up from community team. However, he completes suicide within a week \
  after discharge from hospital. \
\
  In reviewing Mr Morris's case, you realize that your registrar did not notify the out-patient team of Mr Morris' discharge as planned and the out-patient \
  team were unaware of his discharge. \

\
            Amanda, aged 35 years, has had bipolar disorder since she was 24-years-old. She is married and has two pre-school aged children. Amanda had \
            frequent manic episodes in her late 20s, and had a severe postnatal psychotic depression followed by a period of hypomania after the birth of her \
            daughter, who is now 18 months old. \
\
            She is taking Sodium Valproate 1600mg and Olanzapine 20mg daily, and is currently asymptomatic. She says other mood stabilisers have not been \
            effective in preventing relapse of her bipolar disorder in the past. \
\
            You are Amanda's usual psychiatrist at the community mental health service outpatient clinic. At a routine appointment Amanda tells you that she has \
            gained over 20 kilograms on her current medication, despite her attempts to diet. She would like to stop her medication as she feels it is making her \
            look fat and disgusting. \

  Modified Essay 5 \
  The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
  Amanda, aged 35 years, has had bipolar disorder since she was 24-years-old. She is married and has two pre-school aged children. \
  Amanda had frequent manic episodes in her late 20s, and had a severe postnatal psychotic depression followed by a period of hypomania after the \
  birth of her daughter, who is now 18 months old. \
\
   She is taking Sodium Valproate 1600mg and Olanzapine 20mg daily, and is currently asymptomatic. She says other mood stabilisers have not been \
  effective in preventing relapse of her bipolar disorder in the past. \
\
   You are Amanda's usual psychiatrist at the community mental health service outpatient clinic. At a routine appointment Amanda tells you that she has \
  gained over 20 kilograms on her current medication, despite her attempts to diet. She would like to stop her medication as she feels it is making her \
  look fat and disgusting. \
\
  She manages to lose 6 kg in weight and is pleased with her success. She now informs you that she and her husband want to have the third child that \
  they had always planned. \
\
  Amanda asks your advice regarding what to do with her medication when she gets pregnant. \
\
  Question 5.2 \
  Discuss (list and debate) your response to this situation. \

         Encourage Amanda to bring her husband in to an appointment so that all of the risks and benefits of the various options can be                  4 \
         discussed with both of them. \
\
 B.      MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES \

\
            You are a junior consultant at a Community Mental Health Service and you see Madelaine, a 36-year-old single woman who was diagnosed with \
            Schizophrenia at the age of 28 years. She has a history of good medication adherence but she continues to experience frequent distressing auditory \
            hallucinations. \
\
            She is currently taking risperidone 6mg per day orally, but she has significant extrapyramidal side effects. Madelaine was previously prescribed olanzapine \
            with good effect but it caused significant weight gain and she ceased it. \
\
            During your first meeting with Madelaine, she requests a change of medication. \

\
    You are a junior consultant at a Community Mental Health Service and you see Madelaine, a 36-year-old single woman who was diagnosed with \
    Schizophrenia at the age of 28 years. She has a history of good medication adherence but she continues to experience frequent distressing auditory \
    hallucinations. \
\
    She is currently taking risperidone 6mg per day orally, but she has significant extrapyramidal side effects. Madelaine was previously prescribed olanzapine \
     with good effect but it caused significant weight gain and she ceased it. \
\
    During your first meeting with Madelaine, she requests a change of medication. \

   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
    You are a junior consultant at a Community Mental Health Service and you see Madelaine, a 36-year-old single woman who was diagnosed with \
    Schizophrenia at the age of 28 years. She has a history of good medication adherence but she continues to experience frequent distressing auditory \
   hallucinations. \
\
    She is currently taking risperidone 6mg per day orally, but she has significant extrapyramidal side effects. Madelaine was previously prescribed olanzapine \
    with good effect but it caused significant weight gain and she ceased it. \
\
    During your first meeting with Madelaine, she requests a change of medication. \
\
   Madelaine's primary complaints are stiffness and tremor both of which she finds embarrassing, and which interfere with basic tasks. \
\
   Madelaine decides to start clozapine. Baseline blood tests (including tests of cardiac function) are all normal. Her body mass index is 22kg/m2. You start her \
   on the lowest recommended regimen. \
\
   After reaching a dose of 200mg a day in 3 weeks, she reports one incident of a hot and cold sensation the previous night. Physical examination is normal. \
   Her white cell count (WCC) is 4.2 x 10*9/L, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) is 200U/L and her troponin T is normal. An ECG showed that her QTc has increased \
   from 428ms at baseline to 492ms. \
\
   Question 1.4 \
   Outline (list and justify) the approaches to management that you would consider. \
    Please note: a list with no justification will not receive any marks. (6 marks) \
\
  A.      Consultation. Consider medical colleagues (e.g. cardiologist) and/or clozapine information service and/or specialist pharmacist.                O \
          Justification: clarification of the risk/benefit analysis of prolonged QTc.                                                                      1 \
                                                                                                                                                           2 \
\
  B.      i) Cautious continuation. Continue clozapine at the same dose and review patient in a few days: advise her to contact the service               O \
              immediately if she experiences fever, sore throat, chest pain, muscle aches, or flu like symptoms. Repeat ECG. No clear evidence             1 \
              of indication to discontinue: symptoms may settle spontaneously; blood tests are normal. Admission can be considered.                        2 \
\
          ii) Clozapine withdrawal. May be a safe option as there is an increase of the QTc but such a strategy would not provide clear                   O \
              information about the tolerance clozapine in this patient. Regular monitoring with ECG of QTc is indicated. Admission can be                1 \
              considered.                                                                                                                                  2 \
\
          iii) Cautious dose reduction. Lower the dose temporarily and increase again with frequent ECG monitoring: reason. May allow time                O \
              for physiological adjustment. Admission can be considered.                                                                                   1 \
                                                                                                                                                           2 \

  C.      Involve Madelaine and her key family/social supports in decision making.                                                                        O \
                                                                                                                                                           1 \

    Madelaine decides to start clozapine. Baseline blood tests (including tests of cardiac function) are all normal. Her body mass index is 22kg/m2. You start her \
   on the lowest recommended regimen. \
\
   After reaching a dose of 200mg a day in 3 weeks, she reports one incident of a hot and cold sensation the previous night. Physical examination is normal. \
   Her white cell count (WCC) is 4.2 x 10*9/L, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) is 200U/L and her troponin T is normal. An ECG showed that her QTc has increased \
   from 428ms at baseline to 492ms. \
\
   After reviewing the options available with Madelaine, she decides to continue the clozapine at its current dose. However, the following afternoon, Madelaine is \
   admitted to hospital with nausea, lethargy, fever and tachycardia. Her condition deteriorates and she is transferred to the intensive care unit. \
\
   The next morning, Madelaine's mother contacts you by telephone and accuses you of being negligent in Madelaine's care. She is nominated as Madelaine's \
   next-of-kin. \
\
   Question 1.5 \
   Describe (list and explain) how you would respond to the mother's telephone call. \

             You are a junior consultant psychiatrist employed at a community child and adolescent clinic. \
\
             A 14-year-old girl, Emily, is referred to your clinic with 15kg weight loss during the last 6 months. She describes increased food restriction over the last month, \
             eating only leafy vegetables, and jogging for at least an hour a day. She has been amenorrhoeic for 3 months. She presents as an obviously thin girl (BMI is \
             15 kg/m2) wearing oversized clothing, who believes she is still overweight and would like to be thinner. \

\
   You are a junior consultant psychiatrist employed at a community child and adolescent clinic. \
\
  A 14-year-old girl, Emily, is referred to your clinic with 15kg weight loss during the last 6 months. She describes increased food restriction over the last month, \
  eating only leafy vegetables, and jogging for at least an hour a day. She has been amenorrhoeic for 3 months. She presents as an obviously thin girl (BMI is \
   15 kg/m2) wearing oversized clothing, who believes she is still overweight and would like to be thinner. \

\
   Question 5.3 \
   Outline (list and justify) the strategies to reduce the risk of refeeding syndrome. \
   Please note: a list with no justification will not receive any marks. (6 marks) \
\
  A.       Treatment parameters. Multidisciplinary team with experienced dietician, regular review, index of suspicion - allow early identification \
          and tailored response. \
\
  B.       Moderate pace of refeeding - "start low and go slow" (e.g. 6000KJ/1500kcal daily in an adult) due to risk of carbohydrate-induced \
                                                                                                                                                                    O              I \
          insulin release triggering rapid intracellular electrolyte uptake - consider NG if risk of refeeding syndrome considered high - recognize                 1 \
          risk of underfeeding. \
  C.      Low carbohydrate diet/preparations to avoid triggering postprandial rebound hypoglycaemia in people with low glycogen stores.                             O \
\
  D.      Limit oral fluid intake, appropriate to age and weight because excess fluid intake may worsen electrolyte disturbance.                                    O \
\
  E.       Other electrolyte monitoring and supplementation. Potassium, Magnesium.                                                                                  O \

\
  F.      Ongoing daily monitoring in first 1-2 weeks or until goal energy intake is reached: repeat LFTs, electrolytes, ECG, blood sugar.                          O \
                                                                                                                                                                    1 \

   Modified Essay 5 \
   The information that is presented in italics in this question is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
\
   You are a junior consultant psychiatrist employed at a community child and adolescent clinic. \
\
   A 14-year-old girl, Emily, is referred to your clinic with 15kg weight loss during the last 6 months. She describes increased food restriction over the last month, \
   eating only leafy vegetables, and jogging for at least an hour a day. She has been amenorrhoeic for 3 months. She presents as an obviously thin girl (BMI is \
    15 kg/m2) wearing oversized clothing, who believes she is still overweight and would like to be thinner. \
\
    Emily is admitted to a paediatric medical ward. \
\
   Several weeks later, Emily has gained weight and is medically stable. You meet with Emily and her family for discharge planning. \
\
   During previous family meetings, Emily has complained that her parents control her life. Her father, a headmaster, is "never at home". Her mother is a \
   successful interior designer and Emily says "Nothing I do is ever good enough for her". Emily says that her mother has always been preoccupied with her own \
   appearance and weight. \
\
   Question 5.4 \
   Outline (list and justify) the treatment approaches that you would consider discussing with Emily and her parents. \
   Please note: a list with no justification will not receive any marks. (6 marks) \

\
                   Each question within this modified essay will \
                                                                 be marked by a different examiner. The \
                   examiner marking one question will not have access to your answers to the other two \
                   questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and \
                   specifically. For example, answer question 3 fully, even if you believe that you have partly \
                   covered its content in your answers to questions 1 and 2. \
\
                   "Andy" is a 55-year-old immigrant from Iran. He arrived in 1990 after spending several years in a \
                   refugee camp in Pakistan. He speaks limited English. He stated he was a wealthy businessman in \
                   Iran, but was persecuted and forced to leave because of his opposition to the government. He \
                   states he was tortured and beaten on several occasions and walks with a limp as a consequence. \
                   He is referred to the community mental health centre where you work as a registrar. The referring \
                   general practitioner has written that he rarely leaves home. You interview him with a professional \
                   interpreter. You determine that he has become increasingly withdrawn from his family, is \
                   irritable, cannot sleep, and has worsening back pain. He does not consume alcohol. He is \
                   prescribed anti-inflammatory medication and panadeine forte (paracetamol, codeine phosphate). \
                   for his pain. He cannot work because of the back pain. His wife does not work because she \
                   cannot speak English. They have two adolescent children. \
\
                   His general practitioner has previously referred him to the Pain Clinic at the local hospital. He is \
                   having hydrotherapy, which has helped his mobility. \

\
                  The Pain Clinic commences Andy on a low dose of amitriptyline. His sleep and irritability improve   1 \

\
                  Question 1.2 \
                  After an assessment you make a diagnosis of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder. Outline your \
                  approach to treatment. \

\
                  Andy's condition stabilises, but he remains mildly depressed and anxious. He has been living off \
                  the money that he could get out of the country when he left, and loans from other family and the \
                  community. He discloses that his financial reserves are almost depleted. \

                  Stan is a 37-year-old unemployed electrician who has a 20-year history of obsessive-compulsive \
                  disorder. \
                  Stan is unable to leave his house because of checking rituals. His general practitioner has \
                  referred him to the community mental health service. Stan lives with his elderly parents who \
                  shop and cook for him. He has a long history of intermittent contact with mental health services \
      [X]         but has never attended for longer than three months at a time. He has tried many different \
                  medications but has stopped them because he could not tolerate the side-effects. \

                  You assess Stan in his home and confirm that he has no other major psychiatric disorder. Stan \
                  tells you that he has to check switches and power sockets constantly because he fears he will \
                  leave an electrical appliance on and cause harm to his parents. Similar fears have prevented him \
                 from working outside of the home. He would like treatment for his problems as long as it does not. \
                 involve admission to hospital. \

                 Shortly after Stan has commenced his treatment program, his elderly father dies suddenly at \
                 home of a cardiac arrest. \

      Stan is a 37-year-old unemployed electrician \
                                                     who has a 20-year history of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Stan is unable to leave his \
      house because of checking rituals. His general \
                                                       practitioner has referred him to the community mental health service. Stan lives with \
      his elderly parents who shop and cook for him. \
                                                          He has a long history of intermittent contact with mental health services but has \
      never attended for longer than three months at a \
                                                           time. He has tried many different medications but has stopped them because he \
      could not tolerate the side-effects. \
      You assess Stan in his home and confirm that he                                                                       has to check \
                                                             has no other major psychiatric disorder. Stan tells you that he \
      switches and power sockets constantly because he fears he will leave an electrical appliance on and cause harm to his parents. \
      Similar fears have prevented him from working outside of the home. He would like treatment for his problems as long as it does not \
      involve admission to hospital. \

         switches and power sockets constantly \
                                                     because he fears he will leave an electrical appliance on and cause harm to his parents. \

                                                   working outside of the home. He would like treatment for his problems as long as it does not \
          involve admission to hospital. \

\
                Joel, a 10-year-old boy living with his parents and younger brother, is referred to you by his \
                family doctor for review of his medication. Three years ago he was diagnosed by a Paediatrician \
                as having Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Tourette's Disorder, and was \
                commenced on methylphenidate and clonidine with apparently good effect. His parents report \
                that his behaviour is settled at home and he has few tics, but he is making extremely poor \
                academic progress at school. \
\
                Question 1.1 \
                Discuss the factors which are most likely to explain Joel's poor academic progress. Include \
                your reasoning for each factor. \

\
               Joel's mother raises a concern about the potential side-effects of methylphenidate and stimulant \
               medication early in your assessment. She has recently read a magazine article that states that \
               children on stimulants have growth retardation and are likely to become drug addicts. \
\
               Question 1.2 \
               Outline how you would respond to Joel's mother's concerns. \
               (8marks)                                            Please write your response on page 8 \
\
               Even though Joel's ADHD has stabilised on treatment, his Tourette's Disorder is still symptomatic. \
              Joel's mother asks for your advice about management of Joel's Tourette's Disorder. \
\
              Question 1.3 \
               Outline your management of Joel's Tourette's Disorder. \

        Joel, a 10-year-old boy living with his parents and younger brother, is referred to you by his family doctor for review of his medication. \
         Three years ago he was diagnosed by a Paediatrician as having Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Tourette's \
        Disorder, and was commenced on methylphenidate and clonidine with apparently good effect. His parents report that his behaviour is \
        settled at home and he has few tics, but he is making extremely poor academic progress at school. \
\
        Joel's mother raises a concern about the potential side-effects of methylphenidate and stimulant medication early in your assessment. \
                                                                                                                             become drug \

\
            Julia is a 23-year-old married indigenous woman who is referred by her community health nurse \
           to the mental health team, with severe depressive symptoms. Four months ago Julia's first child \
            died at home of a "cot death" at the age of 10 weeks. Since that time Julia has been persistently \
           tearful, sleeping poorly and waking in the night because she thinks she can hear the baby crying. \
            She is avoiding social contact, losing weight, and (blames herself for "not being a good mother". \
           Her mother, who has been staying with her since the baby's death, believes that the baby's death \
           is a punishment for family wrongdoings. \
\
           Question 3.1 \
           Discuss your approach to incorporating a cultural understanding into your interactions with' \
           Julia. \

\
           Question 3.2 \
           Discuss how you would distinguish between normal grief and a major depressive episode \
           in Julia. \
           (7 marks)                                        Please write your response on page 54 \
\
           After the initial assessment, you suggest to Julia that she would benefit from antidepressant \
          treatment. While her husband is keen for her to have this treatment, Julia's mother is adamant \
      .. that Julia needs traditional healing, not medication. Julia is tearful and unable to make any \
          decision. \
\
          Question 3.3 \
          Describe how you would proceed with this situation. \

           severe depressive symptoms. Four months ago Julia's first child died at home of a "cot death" at the age of 10 weeks. Since that time \
           Julia has been persistently tearful, sleeping poorly and waking in the night because she thinks she can hear the baby crying. She is \
           avoiding social contact, losing weight, and blames herself for "not being a good mother". Her mother, who has been staying with her \
          since the baby's death, believes that the baby's death is a punishment for family wrongdoings. \

         The Information that is presented in Italics in questions 2 and 3 of each MEQ is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
         Julia is a 23-year-old married indigenous woman who is referred by her community health nurse to the mental health team, with \
         severe depressive symptoms. Four months ago Julia's first child died at home of a "cot death" at the age of 10 weeks. Since that time \
         Julia has been persistently tearful, sleeping poorly and waking in the night because she thinks she can hear the baby crying. She is \
         avoiding social contact, losing weight, and blames herself for "not being a good mother". Her mother, who has been staying with her \
         since the baby's death, believes that the baby's death is a punishment for family wrongdoings. \

       c.     Differences in cultural manifestations \
              Grief may include specific culturally mediated phenomena or behaviours.                                                     2 \

      Julia is a 23-year-old married \
                                       indigenous woman who is referred by her community health nurse to the mental health team, with \
      severe depressive symptoms. \
                                      Four months ago Julia's first child died at home of a "cot death" at the age of 10 weeks. Since that time \
      Julia has been persistently \
                                   tearful, sleeping poorly and waking in the night because she thinks she can hear the baby crying. She is \
      avoiding social contact, losing \
                                      weight, and blames herself for "not being a good mother". Her mother, who has been staying with her \
      since the baby's death, believes \
                                       that the baby's death is a punishment for family wrongdoings. \
      After the initial assessment, \
                                    you suggest to Julia that she would benefit from antidepressant treatment. While her husband is keen \
      for her to have this \
                            treatment, Julia's mother is adamant that Julia needs traditional healing, not medication. Julia is tearful and \
      unable to make any decision. \

\
Modified Essay Questions: MEQ \
\
    .   You will be asked to mark one or two sub-questions of a modified essay problem. \
    .   MEQ answers are usually worth 1 or 2 marks, reflecting the expected amount of detail. For a 2 mark \
        answer, markers should decide whether a candidate's answer for that domain is worth 2, 1 or 0 \
        marks. \
\
    .   In some instances each sub-question within a modified essay may be marked by different markers. \
        This means that you will not see the answers candidates gave to the other sub-questions of the \
        same essay, and that you can only mark what you have in front of you. If a candidate does not \
        cover the content, but writes that he or she has answered it in another part/section of the paper, the \
        candidate cannot be given credit in the part/section of the MEQ that you are marking. We have \
        been careful to tell the candidates this very clearly at the beginning of each modified essay \
        question. We have written: \
\
              Each question within this modified essay will be marked by a different examiner. The \
              examiner marking one question will not have access to your answers to the other two \
              questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and \
              specifically. Thus, for example, answer question 3 fully, even if you believe that you have \
              partly covered its content in your answers to questions 1 and 2. \
\
    \'b7   To assist you in marking answers, questions may read "Outline your ... ", "Discuss how ... " etc. \
        This is a guide as to the type of answer to look for in a candidates response. \
\
           List means you want a list without anything extra, the list doesn't have to be explained or \
           justified. \
\
            Outline means a list with something extra that indicates a reason for its inclusion. \
\
               Marking guide for 'Outline' is as follows: \
               0 = The candidate: \
                   a. writes nothing, or little, or merely lists category heading or is overgeneralised or is \
                       wrong; and \
                   b. the candidate provides no description, explanation or rationale. \
\
         1 Discuss means a substantial answer, covering a number of points with some analysis about its \
           inclusion in the answer. \
\
           Marking guide for 'Discuss' is as follows: \
               0 = The candidate: \
                     a. writes nothing, or little, or merely lists category heading or is overgeneralised or \
                          is \
                        wrong; and \
                     b. the candidate provides no description, explanation or rationale. \
\
                1 = The candidate shows an average grasp of the issues either: \
                     a. by dealing with only one dimension of the answer but does provide in depth \
                         reasoning or description for this dimension; or \
                     b. by identifying several elements of the answer with some reasoning and \
                         description but not in any depth. \
\
               2 = The candidate shows a very good grasp of the issues \
                     a. by dealing with several dimensions of the answer providing in-depth reasoning or \
                         description; or \
                     b. by covering an extensive range of issues, each being discussed, but not \
                         necessarily to the depth of 2a. \

\
\'b7   Scoring keys reflect only one way of organizing the answer. Candidates may organize information \
    in a different manner. However, we anticipate that the scoring keys will cover the required content. \
    Markers may need to be flexible in accepting a variety of answer structures. In this case it is a \
    matter of using the scoring key provided to ensure that candidates adequately cover the required \
    content. \
\
.   If you consider that there is an additional correct answer please discuss this with your marking \
    group leader. If the group leader agrees that there is one or more additional correct answers then \
    there will be a change in the scoring key. Please immediately email the Co-Chairs of the Written \
    Subcommittee or the Secretariat of any change to the scoring key. A change in the scoring key will \
    not increase the total number of marks awarded for that part of the MEQ. Note that on the scoring \
    keys we have left a stippled box (Spare) available to be used if the decision is made that there is \
    another acceptable answer. Otherwise don't dabble with the stipple. \
\
.   To indicate your score, you simply shade in the appropriate bubble on the right hand side of the \
   page with a 2B pencil. \
\
\'b7   W bubble; (this will be included in Feedback to candidates) - mark this bubble if you find that a \
    candidate's hand writing is difficult to read, but you are able to give a score. Remember that if a \
    candidate has an illegible script you are not obliged to mark it. You must discuss such a case \
    with your marking group leader, who will discuss it with the Co-Chairs of the Writtens \
    Subcommittee. \
\
 . Please write your initials in box and indicate your allocated ID number by shading in the relevant \
    bubble at the bottom of the page (this is the small price you pay for not doing all those arithmetical \
    additions). \

          There are 5 dimensions. All are weighted equally. Every dimension is scored on a 9-point scale from 0 to 8, each point on the scale being specified. A total of 40 \
          marks is possible. This essay is marked independently by two examiners. The scores from the two examiners are averaged, so that a final score out of 40 is entered \
          into the database. If the marks given by the two examiners differ by more than 15%, a third examiner will also mark the essay, to adjudicate. \
       Dimension 1. Capacity to produce a logical argument and critical reasoning \
                                                                                                                                                                        - \
          There is no evidence of logical argument or critical reasoning. \
                                                                                                                                                             1          - \
          Points are random or unconnected or listed; or assertions are unsupported or false; or there is no conclusion.                                     2 \
                                                                                                                                                             3 \
          The points in this essay follow logically, but there is only a weak attempt at supporting the assertions by correct and relevant knowledge.        4 \
                                                                                                                                                             5 \
          The points to demonstrate the argument in this essay follow logically, and assertions are supported by correct and relevant knowledge.             6 \
                                                                                                                                                             7 \
          The candidate demonstrates a highly sophisticated level of reasoning and logical argument. \
\
        Dimension 2. Flexibility \
          The candidate restricts himself or herself to an extremely narrow and very rigid line of argument.                                                0 \
                                                                                                                                                             1 \
          The candidate considers only one point of view.                                                                                                    2 \

          The candidate considers more than one point of view, but their strengths and weaknesses are poorly evaluated.                                     4 \
                                                                                                                                                            5 \
          The candidate considers more than one point of view and the strengths and weaknesses of each view are well evaluated.                             \'ae \
\
          The candidate demonstrates a highly sophisticated capacity to set out and evaluate more than one point of view.                                   \'ae           . \
\
       Dimension 3. Ability to communicate \
          The spelling, grammar or vocabulary renders the essay extremely difficult to understand; or it is totally unintelligible.                        O \
          The spelling, grammar or vocabulary significantly impedes communication.                                                                          2 \

          The spelling, grammar and vocabulary are acceptable but the candidate demonstrates poor capacity for written expression.                          4        [X] \
                                                                                                                                                           5 \

\
          The candidate displays a highly sophisticated level of written expression.                                                                       \'ae \
\
       Dimension 4. Judgment, experience and maturity and ethical awareness \
          The candidate demonstrates an absence of any capacity for judgment; or judgments are grossly unethical.                                          O \
         Judgments are na\'efve; or superficial; or extremely poorly thought through; or unethical.                                                            2 \

\
                Modified Essay 1 \
                (25 marks) \
\
                Each question within this modified essay will be marked by a different.examiner. The \
                examiner marking one question will not have access to your answers to the other two \
                questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and \
                specifically. For example, answer question 3 fully, even if you believe that you have partly \
                covered its content in your answers to questions 1 and 2. \
\
                Sid is a 34-year-old single man who presented to the Emergency Department of a major teaching \
                hospital, stating 'my life is in a mess and I might harm myself or kill someone'. Sid had ceased \
                taking prescribed medications, including venlafaxine two weeks previously, and ceased taking \
                prescribed dexamphetamine sulfate one week ago. \
\
                He was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) at the age of 31 years. \
                He reported a history of difficulties with concentration, sticking at and completing tasks, and .. .. \
                being easily distracted. He was prescribed four 5 mg dexamphetamine sulfate tablets each day. \
                He admitted to frequently running out of the dexamphetamine and supplementing it with "street \
                speed" to maintain the beneficial effect. He has also started to inject crushed dexamphetamine \
                sulfate tablets. \
\
                Sid is a skilled plasterer who previously worked for a small company but eventually lost his job \
                because of erratic attendance and anger control problems. He has had repeated difficulty maintaining \
               employment. He now works for himself but is in debt because of difficulty in managing his business. \
                He says he is nervous and worries a lot. He was last admitted to a psychiatric unit three years ago, \
               after presenting to hospital complaining of mood swings and suicidal ideation. \
\
               Sid is admitted to the acute adult inpatient psychiatry unit because of his suicidal risk, and you \
               are the registrar on the team who will manage him. \
\
               Question 1.1 \
               List the diagnostic possibilities for Sid and indicate which features of the above vignette \
               support the diagnosis. \

\
               Sid says he has not told his treating psychiatrist about his misuse of dexamphetamine sulfate \
               and does not want him to be notified. \
\

\
      The information that is presented in italics in questions 2 and 3 of each MEQ is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
      Sid is a 34-year-old single man who presented to the Emergency Department of a major teaching hospital, stating 'my life is in a mess \
      and I might harm myself or kill someone'. Sid had ceased taking prescribed medications, including venlafaxine two weeks previously, \
      and ceased taking prescribed dexamphetamine sulfate one week ago. \
      He was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) at the age of 31 years. He reported a history of difficulties with \
      concentration, sticking at and completing tasks, and being easily distracted. He was prescribed four 5 mg dexamphetamine sulfate \
      tablets each day. He admitted to frequently running out of the dexamphetamine and supplementing it with "street speed" to maintain \
      the beneficial effect. He has also started to inject crushed dexamphetamine sulfate tablets. \
      Sid is a skilled plasterer who previously worked for a small company but eventually lost his job because of erratic attendance and \
      anger control problems. He has had repeated difficulty maintaining employment. He now works for himself but is in debt because of \
      difficulty in managing his business. He says he is nervous and worries a lot. He was last admitted to a psychiatric unit three years ago, \
      after presenting to hospital complaining of mood swings and suicidal ideation. \
[ ] \
      Sid is admitted to the acute adult inpatient psychiatry unit because of his suicidal risk, and you are the registrar on the team who will \
      manage him. \
      Sid says he has not told his treating psychiatrist about his misuse of dexamphetamine sulfate and does not want him to be notified. \
      The nursing staff of the inpatient unit are interested in learning about Adult ADHD. You are asked by the director of the unit to provide \
      a 30 minute educational session to members of the staff as part of the unit's ongoing staff development programme. \

         The information that is presented in italics in questions 2 and 3 of each MEQ is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
         Lynne is an 18-year-old first year university student. She has stopped attending lectures because of panic attacks and agoraphobic \
         avoidance, and she fears that she will fail her forthcoming examinations. \
\
        Lynne moved into student accommodation when she commenced university. She has found the change very difficult. She does not \
         like the student accommodation and making friends has been difficult for her. She has no previous history of psychiatric treatment. \
         She has consulted a psychologist at the student counselling service for support, but her panic attacks and agoraphobic avoidance \
         have not improved and she no longer wants to see this person. She consulted a general practitioner who prescribed citalopram. Lynne \
        stopped taking citalopram after a few days because it made her feel "weird". \
\
        Having reviewed Lynne's symptoms, and excluded organic and other psychiatric disorders, you agree with Lynne that non- \
        pharmacological strategies might be useful to manage her anxiety. \
\
        'n collaboration with Lynne, you decide to treat her with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). \

                     Each question within this modified essay will be marked by a different examiner. The \
                     examiner marking one question will not have access to your answers to the other two \
                     questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and \
                     specifically For example, answer question 3 fully, even if you believe that you have partly \
                     covered its content in your answers to questions 1 and 2. \
\
                     You are a psychiatric registrar in a psychiatric hospital that receives voluntary and involuntary \
                     patients. You are asked to see Karen, a 35-year-old married mother of three, who has been \
                     brought to the hospital by police. She had leapt out of the car driven by her husband, George, \
                    when it was stationary at traffic lights. She suffered no injury. \
\
                     Karen appears mute and preoccupied. Her husband says she has no psychiatric history. She has \
                     previously had grand mal epilepsy but has not taken her sodium valproate regularly for many \
                     months. George reports that Karen has been increasingly withdrawn and mute for several weeks. \
\
                    Question 3.1 \
                     Assuming that the account is accurate, please outline your initial management plan. \
                     (9 marks)                                            Please write your response on page 40 \
\
                     Further history from her husband, George, is that Karen has mild intellectual impairment, and \
                    that she has had some physical clumsiness and incoordination since childhood. Karen was raised \
                    by non-English-speaking parents who emigrated from a rural area of Eastern Europe before she \
                    was born. She did not attend school beyond the age of 14 years. \
\
                    George tells you that he has restraining orders against both his and her parents. He states that \
                    this is because both families are always trying to interfere.           1 \
\
                    Question 3.2 \
                    Please outline how this further history may impact on your longer-term management \
                    of Karen. \
                    (9 marks)                                            Please write your response on page 46 \
\
                    Karen recovers and is discharged from hospital. You follow her up in the outpatient clinic. After \
                    you have seen her for some months, she attends with her 10-year-old son, Jimi. Jimi repeatedly \
                    hits his mother during the interview and states that he will 'tell his father on her'. Karen alludes to \
                    domestic violence from George. She is convinced that if she were to leave him, he would 'get the \
                    kids because he says I'm crazy'. \
\
                    Question 3.3 \
                    Discuss your concerns at this time and outline your management options. \

        The information that is presented in italics in questions 2 and 3 of each MEQ is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
        You are a psychiatric registrar in a psychiatric hospital that receives voluntary and involuntary patients. You are asked to see Karen, a \
        35-year-old married mother of three, who has been brought to the hospital by police. She had leapt out of the car driven by her \
        husband, George, when it was stationary at traffic lights. She suffered no injury. \
\
        Karen appears mute and preoccupied. Her husband says she has no psychiatric history. She has previously had grand mal epilepsy \
        but has not taken her sodium valproate regularly for many months. George reports that Karen has been increasingly withdrawn and \
        mute for several weeks. \
\
        Further history from her husband, George, is that Karen has mild intellectual impairment, and that she has had some physical \
        clumsiness and incoordination since childhood. Karen was raised by non-English-speaking parents who emigrated from a rural area of \
        Eastern Europe before she was born. She did not attend school beyond the age of 14 years. \
  [ ] \
        George tells you that he has restraining orders against both his and her parents. He states that this is because both families are always \
        trying to interfere. \
\
        Question 3.2 \
        Please outline how this further history may impact on your longer-term management of Karen. (9 marks) \
\
                                                                                                                                               I \
       A.    Longer-term management of untreated epilepsy/psychosis/depression will involve forming a rapport with Karen and George, \
             and engaging them in her treatment. All the following factors will affect this. \
                                                                                                                                    2 \
\
       B.    Non-English-speaking background: clear communication, checking that she understands, repeating information about the O \
              purpose and goal of hospitalization                                                                                   2 \
\
       C.     Cultural factors: the stigma and shame surrounding the epilepsy and mental illness                                   O \
                                                                                                                                    1 \
                                                                                                                                    2 \
\
       D.     Limited education and low IQ: importance of providing appropriate level of information, repetition of information, maybe simple O \
              written material, ensuring that staff understand this problem \
                                                                                                                                    2 \
\
       E.    Husband's mental state: possibly paranoid, appears to be excessively controlling; may need to specifically engage him in order \
             to access Karen or, conversely, may need to encourage Karen to strengthen other relationships, etc. *                  1 \
\
       F.    Capacity of Karen and George to parent their children: need to assess the appropriateness of George's response to both sets of \
                                                                                                                                    1 \

\
       G.    Children: assess their emotional state, their safety, their isolation from both extended families, and the effect of Karen's illness \
             and low IQ.                                                                                                           2 \

\
              Each question within this modified essay will be marked by a different examiner. The \
              examiner marking one question will not have access to your answers to the other two \
              questions. Therefore, please ensure that you address each question separately and \
              specifically. For example, answer question 3 fully, even if you believe that you have partly \
              covered its content in your answers to questions 1 and 2. \
\
              You are working in an outpatient child and adolescent service. The clinical psychologist asks \
              you to see a 13-year-old girl, Dusty, and her mother Nancy, a single parent. Dusty has recently \
              presented with symptoms of obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviour involving fear of \
              contamination with germs. The family's water bill has increased fourfold in the past few months \
              as a result of Dusty's hand-washing and her mother's laundering of Dusty's bed linen whenever . \
              it touches the floor or touches something that has touched the floor. \
\
              The psychologist tells you that Dusty's mother, Nancy, was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia \
              about 10 years ago and is maintained on clozapine. He has found it very difficult to get any \
              information from Nancy. Dusty's younger sister, Billie, is seven years old and also lives at home. \
\
              Question 4.1 \
              Outline the issues that you would particularly attend to at your initial assessment of Dusty. \
              Give your reasons. \
              (7 marks)                                         Please write your response on page 59 \
\
           . After the initial assessment, you are unclear as to whether Dusty has a diagnosis of a primary \
              Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) or whether her symptoms are secondary to her mother's \
              condition. You arrange for a follow-up interview with Nancy, Dusty and Billie. Nancy's former \
             partner left the country six years ago and his whereabouts are unknown. Nancy is estranged from \
             her own parents. It becomes clear that Nancy is very protective of her daughters. She has \
             forbidden them to give out their address or telephone number to other children at school. She \
             will not let them go to other children's houses. She walks both daughters to and from school. \
             She believes that Dusty's fear of germs would be handled best by arranging home schooling so \
             that Dusty does not need to confront dirty environments. \
\
             Question 4.2 \
             Discuss your interventions. \
             (10 marks)                                        Please write your response on page 65 \
\
             After some months, Nancy says she does not want to keep bringing Dusty to the clinic, and \
             requests 'a cure' for Dusty's OCD. She mentions that her own psychiatrist has said he thinks \
             Dusty should be 'on medication'. Nancy has also seen 'miracle surgery' for OCD on television. \
\
             Question 4.3 \
             Discuss your response to Nancy's request. \
             (8 marks)                                         Please write your response on page 71 \

                                              MARCH          2008                                                     [X] \
\
         The information that is presented in italics in questions 2 and 3 of each MEQ is a repetition of the earlier sections of the case vignette. \
         You are working in an outpatient child and adolescent service. The clinical psychologist asks you to see a 13-year-old girl, Dusty, and \
         her mother Nancy, a single parent. Dusty has recently presented with symptoms of obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviour \
         involving fear of contamination with germs. The family's water bill has increased fourfold in the past few months as a result of Dusty's \
         hand-washing and her mother's laundering of Dusty's bed linen whenever it touches the floor or touches something that has touched \
         the floor. \
\
         The psychologist tells you that Dusty's mother, Nancy, was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia about 10 years ago and is \
         maintained on clozapine. He has found it very difficult to get any information from Nancy. Dusty's younger sister, Billie, is seven years \
         old and also lives at home. \
\
         After the initial assessment, you are unclear as to whether Dusty has a diagnosis of a primary Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) \
   [ ] or whether her symptoms are secondary to her mother's condition. You arrange for a follow-up interview with Nancy, Dusty and Billie. \
         Vancy's former partner left the country six years ago and his whereabouts are unknown. Nancy is estranged from her own parents. It \
        becomes clear that Nancy is very protective of her daughters. She has forbidden them to give out their address or telephone number \
        to other children at school. She will not let them go to other children's houses. She walks both daughters to and from school. She \
         believes that Dusty's fear of germs would be handled best by arranging home schooling so that Dusty does not need to confront dirty \
        environments. \
\
        After some months, Nancy says she does not want to keep bringing Dusty to the clinic, and requests 'a cure' for Dusty's OCD. She \
        mentions that her own psychiatrist has said he thinks Dusty should be 'on medication'. Nancy has also seen 'miracle surgery' for OCD \
        on television. \
\
        Question 4.3                                             2.17 \
        Discuss your response to Nancy's request. (8 marks) \
\
       A      Nature of the Approach: Be non-defensive. Understand the subtext (she may be concerned about lack of progress, or she may \
              realise how much she, herself, has been helped by clozapine and other medications).                                   1 \
                                                                                                                                     2 \
       B.     Explanation about potential medications. \
              Against medication: May not be necessary in mild to moderate OCD. Potential side effects. Stigmatization. Lethality of some 1 \
             medications, such as clomipramine, in overdose. Risk to all family members, including Billie. SSRIs may increase the risk of \
             suicidal thoughts. \
             In favour of medication: Best used in moderate to severe OCD, in conjunction with CBT / family interventions. Effects of O \
             medication last only as long as it is taken. \
                                                                                                                                    2 \
      D.     Content - psychosurgery cingulotomy. \
             Has a place for severe, intractable OCD, but only after all other treatments have failed. It is not appropriate at this early stage. \
             Other types of surgery are unproven.                                                                                   2 \
      E.     Liaise with Nancy's psychiatrist / treatment team, continue to engage Nancy in further psycho-education.               O \
\
      F.     Child protection, etc., in case the steps above fail, putting Dusty is at risk. \
                                                                                                                                    D \

                tells you that Sally, a 24 year old female patient recovering from a manic episode, has just told her \
                nurse that Damien, a 30 year old man diagnosed with schizophrenia, sexually assaulted her during \
                the previous night. Damien is under your care, whereas Sally is under the care of a different \

               tells you that Sally, a 24 year old female patient \
                                                           recovering from a manic episode, has just told her \

              her                                      has no prior psychiatric history and nor does anyone in \
                  family except for her birth father \
                                                 who had no formal diagnosis but committed suicide when she \
              was two years old. He is said \
                                            to have been "moody" and also abused alcohol and was physically \
              abusive to Shayleen's mother. \
              Shayleen had a normal delivery after an \
                                                    unplanned and unwanted pregnancy. The child's father has \
              left town and is not \
                                  contactable. Shayleen is currently free of psychotic symptoms, having briefly \
              been thought-disordered and with \
                                               persecutory and grandiose delusions. These settled a week ago, \
              on quetiapine 200mgs nocte. She is also taking temazepam 20mgs nocte for sleep and is not \
              breast-feeding. Her mood is somewhat labile and irritable and her mother is having to do a lot of the \
              feeds as Shayleen is drowsy at night and reluctant to get up if the baby wakes. During the \
              appointment you notice that Shayleen either gives Jake to her mother or places him in his pram, \
              and that she seems reluctant to hold him for long. \
